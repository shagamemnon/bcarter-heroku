Therefore, your meals can be larger and more satiating – instead of eating really small meals all throughout the day that don’t fill you up in the least..</p><p><strong>When you’re hungry all day, it’s really tough staying focused and motivated.</strong>.</p><p>That’s why most “diets” are doomed to fail. That, and you’re MUCH more likely to cheat as you only have a limited amount of willpower to use every day. Use it up trying not to eat earlier in the day, and you’ll find yourself much more likely to snack at night.<br /> .</p><p><h2>The Effects Of Fasting On Fat Loss</h2><p>During that sixteen-hour fasting period, without consuming anything to burn for energy, you're basically putting your body in a position to stay alive – to move and to go about your day – so your body has to tap into the only reserves it has for energy: <em>fat</em>..</p><p>By fasting daily, you’re forcing your body into this fat burning state <em>every day</em>..</p><p>And it works really well… .</p><p><u>I've seen people lose fat WITHOUT working out</u>..</p><p>All they did was put themselves in a caloric deficit, because if you're burning more calories than you consume, you're going to lose fat whether you work out or not..</p><p>That's why your diet is so critical. Intermittent fasting really helps you stay in a caloric deficit..</p><p>It works better than cardio, too.

Then I eat during my feeding window, and fast till the next day..</p><p> <br />\n<p><u>Here’s what it looks like to get a better idea:</u>.</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>8:00am</strong> -- Wake up; 1-2 cups of Black Coffee (no sugar or cream).</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>1:30pm</strong> -- Pre Workout - “Rebellion” (Pre Workout) + 10 Grams of BCAA.</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>3:00pm</strong> -- Meal #1 (Post-Workout).</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>5:00pm</strong> -- Meal #2.</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>8:00pm</strong> -- Meal #3.</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>11:00pm </strong>-- Meal #4.</p><p> <br />\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TZSQJ9t1vA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    <p><strong>To learn more and get your custom meal plan, <a href=\"http://highlife.link/mealplan\">click here</a>.</strong>.</p><p>\n    <h2>Why This Is So Effective…</h2><p>When you wake up and push your first meal to later in the day (and stick to this “feeding window”), you’re essentially cramming MORE food into a smaller window of time. Therefore, your meals can be larger and more satiating – instead of eating really small meals all throughout the day that don’t fill you up in the least..</p><p><strong>When you’re hungry all day, it’s really tough staying focused and motivated.</strong>.</p><p>That’s why most “diets” are doomed to fail. That, and you’re MUCH more likely to cheat as you only have a limited amount of willpower to use every day. Use it up trying not to eat earlier in the day, and you’ll find yourself much more likely to snack at night.<br /> .</p><p><h2>The Effects Of Fasting On Fat Loss</h2><p>During that sixteen-hour fasting period, without consuming anything to burn for energy, you're basically putting your body in a position to stay alive – to move and to go about your day – so your body has to tap into the only reserves it has for energy: <em>fat</em>..</p><p>By fasting daily, you’re forcing your body into this fat burning state <em>every day</em>..</p><p>And it works really well… .</p><p><u>I've seen people lose fat WITHOUT working out</u>..</p><p>All they did was put themselves in a caloric deficit, because if you're burning more calories than you consume, you're going to lose fat whether you work out or not..</p><p>That's why your diet is so critical. Intermittent fasting really helps you stay in a caloric deficit..</p><p>It works better than cardio, too. Cardio helps, but being in a caloric deficit is the best (and easiest) way to go. .</p><p><strong>You can't out-train a bad diet.<br /> </strong>.</p><p><h2>Your Next Steps</h2><p>Fasting is an important part of losing body fat and cutting up to get that coveted six pack..</p><p>I use this strategy every day, and recommend you do too..</p><p>But, this only scratches the surface of intermittent fasting....</p><p>If you want to learn more about it and exactly how I use it to stay shredded year-round, then <a href=\"http://big.brandoncarter.com/special-offers/get-ripped-fast/\">check out my Get Ripped Fast program by clicking here</a>..</p><p>I lay out my entire nutrition strategy - along with the exact workout protocol that supports that nutrition strategy..</p><p>The result....</p><p>Getting shredded as fast as humanly possible..</p><p>\n    <a href=\"/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/pillar-4\" target=\"_self\" role=\"button\">\n                Pillar #4: Lifting Strategies\n            </a></p>\n\n<h1>  \n        Want my FULL program for losing body fat fast?\n    </h1>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"http://big.brandoncarter.com/special-offers/get-ripped-fast/\" target=\"_self\" role=\"button\"&gt;\n            Click Here\n        &lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>  \n        EXPLORE\n    </h3>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ul id=\"menu-ssps-menu\"&gt;&lt;li id=\"menu-item-22532\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/\"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><li id=\"menu-item-26445\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/pillar-1/\">Pillar #1: Caloric Intake for Losing Weight</a></li> <br />\n<li id=\"menu-item-26444\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/pillar-2/\">Pillar #2: Caloric Intake for Building Muscle</a></li> <br />\n<li id=\"menu-item-26446\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/pillar-3/\">Pillar #3: Nutrient Timing</a></li> <br />\n<li id=\"menu-item-26465\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/pillar-4/\">Pillar #4: Lifting Strategies</a></li> <br />\n<li id=\"menu-item-26463\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/pillar-5/\">Pillar #5: Cheat Days</a></li> <br />\n<li id=\"menu-item-26464\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/pillar-6/\">Pillar #6: Abs Training</a></li> <br />\n<li id=\"menu-item-22554\"><a href=\"http://highlife.link/mealplans\">Get Your Custom Meal Plan</a></li> <br />\n<li id=\"menu-item-22555\"><a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/rebellion/\">Supplementation For Performance</a></li> <br />\n<li id=\"menu-item-22556\"><a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/tea-rexx/\">Supplementation For Fat Loss</a></li> <br />\n</ul><h3> <br />\n        Why Not Treat Yourself?\n    </h3>\n                <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/tea-rexx/\" target=\"_blank\" itemprop=\"url\">\n                <img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/08/03165148/tea-rexx-498x498-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\"  />\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/rebellion/\" target=\"_blank\" itemprop=\"url\">\n                <img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/13025042/rebellion-3.png\" alt=\"rebellion 3\" itemprop=\"image\"  />\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/product/bodyweight-blast/\" target=\"_blank\" itemprop=\"url\">\n                <img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/10/20112101/imacright_790x926.png\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\"  />\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"http://big.brandoncarter.com/special-offers/get-ripped-fast/\" target=\"_blank\" itemprop=\"url\">\n                <img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/08/02212110/fbb-boxshot.png\" alt=\"fbb-boxshot\" itemprop=\"image\"  />\n                </a></p>","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-11-13 02:50:42","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-11-13 02:50:42","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-11-13 02:50:42","published_by":1},{"id":1995,"uuid":"ff2d3c16-9fd5-42c7-936f-c1c7b09ad3f3","title":"Pillar 4 - Lifting Strategy","slug":"pillar-4","markdown":"<h1>\n\t\tPillar #4: <br />Lifting To Build Lean Muscle And Remove Body Fat\n\t</h1>\n\t<p>I’m willing to bet that you've probably wasted many hours in the gym.

Food packaging these days often come with sketchy labeling to convince you the food is somehow healthier. Labels like fat-free, sugar-free, low carbs, or 50% less sodium are supposed to convince consumers that the food is a healthier option. Don’t fall for the ploy..</p><p>Typically, a food that has less of something is not going to taste as good, which means manufacturers have to compensate for it by adding additional ingredients. Foods labeled fat-free for instance, may contain more refined sugar. Likewise, foods with the sugar-free label may contain unhealthy doses of artificial sweeteners..</p><p><h3>What About Organic Foods?</h3><p>Organic options are usually – but not always – a better choice. Once again, just because a food is made using organic ingredients does not automatically make it healthy. Take sugar, for instance; alternatives like cane sugar, evaporated cane juice, or agave syrup are often used in place of high fructose corn syrup and given the organic label. While these substitutes may be natural, they spike your blood sugar levels just the same as regular table sugar..</p><p><h1>\n\t\tWant my FULL program for losing body fat fast?\n\t</h1>\n\t<a href=\"http://big.brandoncarter.com/special-offers/get-ripped-fast/\" target=\"_self\" role=\"button\">\n\t\t\t\tClick Here\n\t\t\t</a>\n<h3>\n\t\tEXPLORE\n\t</h3>\n\t<ul id=\"menu-ssps-menu\"><li id=\"menu-item-22532\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/\">Introduction</a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-22531\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/if/\">Pillar #1: Nutrition Strategies</a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-22530\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/lifting-strategies/\">Pillar #2: Lifting Strategies</a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-22529\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/abs-training/\">Pillar #3: Abs Training</a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-22554\"><a href=\"http://highlife.link/mealplans\">Get Your Custom Meal Plan</a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-22555\"><a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/rebellion/\">Supplementation For Performance</a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-22556\"><a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/tea-rexx/\">Supplementation For Fat Loss</a></li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/13025042/11951772_1061633263877485_1800678662672801918_n-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\"  />\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/13025042/11938074_1032272686812716_3915412239660637527_n-300x287.jpg\" alt=\"11938074_1032272686812716_3915412239660637527_n\" itemprop=\"image\"  />\n\t<p><strong>Here are two students of mine that are dedicated to eating the right way to get to the best versions of their selves.</strong>.</p><p><em>Remember Supplements can help, but they are only meant to be a supplements.

Believe me, I, too, would love nothing more than to be able to gorge on chocolate cake, pastrami sandwiches, and soda pop. However, I made a commitment to myself that my health and physique is more important than satisfying my cravings. Also, don’t forget that you don’t have to forgo your favorite foods for the rest of your life; you’re still allotted one cheat day a week. As long as you keep the bigger picture (e.g. flatter tummy, bigger biceps) in mind, you should be able to stick to a healthy eating meal plan and consistently follow through with it..</p><p>[photo credit: <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/76236946@N00/2793753206\">kieshawn</a>, <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/7173744755\">Daniel Oines</a>].</p><p>\n    <a href=\"/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/pillar-2\" target=\"_self\" role=\"button\">\n                Pillar #2: Caloric Intake for Building Muscle\n            </a></p>\n\n<h3>  \n        Why Not Treat Yourself?\n    </h3>\n\n<pre><code>            &lt;a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/tea-rexx/\" target=\"_blank\" itemprop=\"url\"&gt;\n            &lt;img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/08/03165148/tea-rexx-498x498-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\"  /&gt;\n            &lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/rebellion/\" target=\"_blank\" itemprop=\"url\"&gt;\n            &lt;img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/13025042/rebellion-3.png\" alt=\"rebellion 3\" itemprop=\"image\"  /&gt;\n            &lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/product/bodyweight-blast/\" target=\"_blank\" itemprop=\"url\"&gt;\n            &lt;img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/10/20112101/imacright_790x926.png\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\"  /&gt;\n            &lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;a href=\"http://big.brandoncarter.com/special-offers/get-ripped-fast/\" target=\"_blank\" itemprop=\"url\"&gt;\n            &lt;img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/08/02212110/fbb-boxshot.png\" alt=\"fbb-boxshot\" itemprop=\"image\"  /&gt;\n            &lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-11-13 02:50:42","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-11-13 02:50:42","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-11-13 02:50:42","published_by":1},{"id":2004,"uuid":"20f7b58c-dbd4-4591-8979-61ee5476f671","title":"Pillar 2 - Caloric Intake for Lean Muscle Building","slug":"pillar-2","markdown":"<h1>\n\t\tPillar #2:<br />Caloric Intake for Building Muscle\n\t</h1>\n\t<p>Just as many people are self-conscious of being overweight, others are self-conscious of being too skinny. Of course, it’s mostly men who fall into the latter category. Some guys are naturally skinny and want to put on muscle weight. These people are often termed “hardgainers” in the bodybuilding community. I was a hardgainer at one point, especially during my high school years. It took me many years to finally realize that to gain muscle, you need to follow a bodybuilding meal plan on top of your strength training routine..</p><p>\n<h3>Eating for Lean Muscle Gains</h3>\n<p>For a bodybuilding physique, you have to eat like a bodybuilder. In addition to healthy eating, you also have to eat more than your body burns. This will ensure that you put on as much muscle as possible while preventing fat gain or keeping it to a minimum.</p><p>You’re going to have to get used to eating A LOT, especially on your training days..</p><p>\n<h3>How Much You Need to Eat</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/31003644/8573622428_2557f251cb_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/31003644/8573622428_2557f251cb_n.jpg\" alt=\"8573622428_2557f251cb_n\" width=\"320\" height=\"298\" /></a>You need to go above the daily 2,500 recommended calorie allowance. If you’re just starting out, and you’re more concerned about muscle gain than fat loss, then I recommend starting at 3,000 calories on your strength training days. Speaking of your workouts, I suggest you limit – but not completely forgo – cardio training to twice a week. This prevents too much fat accumulation without compromising muscle gains..</p><p>\n<p>At the end of every week, measure your body with a tape measure. I suggest measuring your chest, upper arms, and thighs. As long as you see gains, continue to consume the same amount of calories. If not, then increase the calories by 500. If a 500-calorie increase is too much for you, then increase by 300..</p><p>\n<h3>What to Eat</h3>\n<p>Your body needs fuel in order to build muscle, and it needs an ample amount of protein, carbs, and fat. I don’t recommend low carbs if muscle building is your main goal since your muscles need it for energy. I would suggest a ratio of 50% protein, 25%-35% carbs, and 15%-25% fat..</p><p>\n<p>When it comes to food choice, avoid empty calories and junk food. Training hard in the gym is not a license to eat whatever you want. Foods need to be nutrient-dense without preservatives like trans-fatty acids or high fructose corn syrup..</p><p>\n<p>You can watch the video below to check out some of my favorite bodybuilding foods that I recommend for optimum muscle gains..</p><p>\n\t<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/udYebKcyPK8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><h1>\n\t\tWant my FULL program for losing body fat fast?\n\t</h1>\n\t<a href=\"http://big.brandoncarter.com/special-offers/get-ripped-fast/\" target=\"_self\" role=\"button\">\n\t\t\t\tClick Here\n\t\t\t</a>\n<h3>\n\t\tEXPLORE\n\t</h3>\n\t<ul id=\"menu-ssps-menu\"><li id=\"menu-item-22532\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/\">Introduction</a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-22531\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/if/\">Pillar #1: Nutrition Strategies</a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-22530\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/lifting-strategies/\">Pillar #2: Lifting Strategies</a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-22529\"><a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/abs-training/\">Pillar #3: Abs Training</a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-22554\"><a href=\"http://highlife.link/mealplans\">Get Your Custom Meal Plan</a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-22555\"><a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/rebellion/\">Supplementation For Performance</a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-22556\"><a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/tea-rexx/\">Supplementation For Fat Loss</a></li>\n</ul>\n\t<h3>Sample Meal Plan</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">7:00 am breakfast/pre-workout</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 banana, 1 cup whole milk, 1 scoop whey protein, 1 bagel w/ peanut butter spread</td>\n<td width=\"213\">700 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">9:30 am post-workout</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 banana, 1 cup whole milk, 1.5 scoop whey protein, ½ cup oatmeal, ¼ cup raisins</td>\n<td width=\"213\">700 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">12:00 pm lunch</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Chicken breast sandwich on wheat toasted bread, 1 cup steamed vegetables, 1 cup whole milk</td>\n<td width=\"213\">500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">3:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">½ cup peanuts, 1 cup whole milk, 1 fruit</td>\n<td width=\"213\">350 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">6:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Lean steak, mixed vegetables, ½ cup brown rice</td>\n<td width=\"213\">500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">9:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">I cup whole milk, ¼ cup peanuts</td>\n<td width=\"213\">250 calories</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This is a sample meal plan for a strength training day, which you should be performing 3-5 times a week.

It’s actually quite simple: it means staying away from anything that would typically be labelled as junk food. If you absolutely crave for ice cream, hot dogs, and potato chips, then save them for your cheat day. For the rest of the week, though, you have to stick to a healthy eating meal plan if you hope to achieve maximum fat loss and muscle retention.\n<h3>A Few Rules About Eating Healthy</h3>\nTry to avoid any foods that come in a package. If it does comes wrapped, canned, or boxed, look at the label for the ingredients. If you were to buy a box of oatmeal, for instance, there shouldn’t be anything listed other than rolled oats. If the list is extensive and includes a bunch of other preservatives with names that are barely pronounceable, leave it on the store shelves.\n\nWhen I do my grocery shopping, I don’t ever walk down the different aisles to see what’s available or on sale. For me, it’s all about getting in and getting out. The only sections I visit are the produce, dairy, and meat aisle.\n<h3>The Truth About Food Labels</h3>\n<a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/30205144/7173744755_b81739c631_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/30205144/7173744755_b81739c631_n.jpg\" alt=\"7173744755_b81739c631_n\" width=\"320\" height=\"256\" /></a>You should also be wary of food labels. Food packaging these days often come with sketchy labeling to convince you the food is somehow healthier. Labels like fat-free, sugar-free, low carbs, or 50% less sodium are supposed to convince consumers that the food is a healthier option. Don’t fall for the ploy.\n\nTypically, a food that has less of something is not going to taste as good, which means manufacturers have to compensate for it by adding additional ingredients. Foods labeled fat-free for instance, may contain more refined sugar. Likewise, foods with the sugar-free label may contain unhealthy doses of artificial sweeteners.\n<h3>What About Organic Foods?</h3>\nOrganic options are usually – but not always – a better choice. Once again, just because a food is made using organic ingredients does not automatically make it healthy. Take sugar, for instance; alternatives like cane sugar, evaporated cane juice, or agave syrup are often used in place of high fructose corn syrup and given the organic label. While these substitutes may be natural, they spike your blood sugar levels just the same as regular table sugar.\n\n[lp-logic ids=\"26472\" limit=1\"></iframe>\n[lp-logic ids=\"26481\" limit=1\"></iframe>\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/13025042/11951772_1061633263877485_1800678662672801918_n-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/13025042/11938074_1032272686812716_3915412239660637527_n-300x287.jpg\" alt=\"11938074_1032272686812716_3915412239660637527_n\" />\n\n<strong>Here are two students of mine that are dedicated to eating the right way to get to the best versions of their selves.</strong>\n\n<em>Remember Supplements can help, but they are only meant to be a supplements.

I have helped hundreds of clients create a dietary plan that is completely manageable and designed to address their specific goals, whether that be fat loss or muscle growth.\n<h3>Make It a Lifestyle</h3>\nLook, I get it; eating healthy is no fun. Believe me, I, too, would love nothing more than to be able to gorge on chocolate cake, pastrami sandwiches, and soda pop. However, I made a commitment to myself that my health and physique is more important than satisfying my cravings. Also, don’t forget that you don’t have to forgo your favorite foods for the rest of your life; you’re still allotted one cheat day a week. As long as you keep the bigger picture (e.g. flatter tummy, bigger biceps) in mind, you should be able to stick to a healthy eating meal plan and consistently follow through with it.\n\n[photo credit: <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/76236946@N00/2793753206\">kieshawn</a>, <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/7173744755\">Daniel Oines</a>\"></iframe>\n\n<a href=\"/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/pillar-2\" target=\"_self\">\nPillar #2: Caloric Intake for Building Muscle\n</a>\n<h3>Why Not Treat Yourself?</h3>\n<a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/tea-rexx/\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/08/03165148/tea-rexx-498x498-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/rebellion/\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/13025042/rebellion-3.png\" alt=\"rebellion 3\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/product/bodyweight-blast/\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/10/20112101/imacright_790x926.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"http://big.brandoncarter.com/special-offers/get-ripped-fast/\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/08/02212110/fbb-boxshot.png\" alt=\"fbb-boxshot\" />\n</a>\"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h1>Pillar #1:  \nCaloric Intake for Losing Weight</h1>  \n\n<p>What does it mean to eat healthy?

The only sections I visit are the produce, dairy, and meat aisle.  </p>\n\n<h3>The Truth About Food Labels</h3>  \n\n<p><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/30205144/7173744755_b81739c631_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/30205144/7173744755_b81739c631_n.jpg\" alt=\"7173744755_b81739c631_n\" width=\"320\" height=\"256\" /></a>You should also be wary of food labels. Food packaging these days often come with sketchy labeling to convince you the food is somehow healthier. Labels like fat-free, sugar-free, low carbs, or 50% less sodium are supposed to convince consumers that the food is a healthier option. Don’t fall for the ploy.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, a food that has less of something is not going to taste as good, which means manufacturers have to compensate for it by adding additional ingredients. Foods labeled fat-free for instance, may contain more refined sugar. Likewise, foods with the sugar-free label may contain unhealthy doses of artificial sweeteners.  </p>\n\n<h3>What About Organic Foods?</h3>  \n\n<p>Organic options are usually – but not always – a better choice. Once again, just because a food is made using organic ingredients does not automatically make it healthy. Take sugar, for instance; alternatives like cane sugar, evaporated cane juice, or agave syrup are often used in place of high fructose corn syrup and given the organic label. While these substitutes may be natural, they spike your blood sugar levels just the same as regular table sugar.</p>\n\n<p>[lp-logic ids=\"26472\" limit=1\"></iframe>\n[lp-logic ids=\"26481\" limit=1\"></iframe>\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/13025042/11951772_1061633263877485_1800678662672801918_n-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <br />\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/13025042/11938074_1032272686812716_3915412239660637527_n-300x287.jpg\" alt=\"11938074_1032272686812716_3915412239660637527_n\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Here are two students of mine that are dedicated to eating the right way to get to the best versions of their selves.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Remember Supplements can help, but they are only meant to be a supplements. Most of my students take <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/tea-rexx/\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a> to support their weight loss goals and using <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/rebellion-shipwire/\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> to give them the edge while working out.</em>  </p>\n\n<h3>Sample Meal Plan</h3>  \n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">7:00 am breakfast</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">1 cup milk, 1 banana, ½ cup oatmeal</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">9:30 am</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Sliced fruit and vegetable mix</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">12:00 pm lunch</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Whole wheat tortilla wrap w/ sliced chicken breast, vegetables on the side</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">3:00 pm</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">½ cup peanuts or almonds, 1 cup milk, 1 fruit</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">6:00 pm dinner</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Lean beef on whole wheat bun, 100% virgin olive oil dressing, 1 fruit</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">9:00 pm</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">1 cup milk</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<p>This is just one of many meal plans you can devise. If you’re at a lost when formulating your own weekly meals, then let me <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/product/custom-meal-plan/\">customize a meal plan</a> for you. I have helped hundreds of clients create a dietary plan that is completely manageable and designed to address their specific goals, whether that be fat loss or muscle growth.  </p>\n\n<h3>Make It a Lifestyle</h3>  \n\n<p>Look, I get it; eating healthy is no fun. Believe me, I, too, would love nothing more than to be able to gorge on chocolate cake, pastrami sandwiches, and soda pop. However, I made a commitment to myself that my health and physique is more important than satisfying my cravings. Also, don’t forget that you don’t have to forgo your favorite foods for the rest of your life; you’re still allotted one cheat day a week. As long as you keep the bigger picture (e.g. flatter tummy, bigger biceps) in mind, you should be able to stick to a healthy eating meal plan and consistently follow through with it.</p>\n\n<p>[photo credit: <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/76236946@N00/2793753206\">kieshawn</a>, <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/7173744755\">Daniel Oines</a>\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/programs/simple-6-pack-solution/pillar-2\" target=\"_self\"> <br />\nPillar #2: Caloric Intake for Building Muscle <br />\n</a>  </p>\n\n<h3>Why Not Treat Yourself?</h3>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/tea-rexx/\" target=\"_blank\"> <br />\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/08/03165148/tea-rexx-498x498-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br />\n</a> <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/rebellion/\" target=\"_blank\"> <br />\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/13025042/rebellion-3.png\" alt=\"rebellion 3\" /> <br />\n</a> <br />\n<a href=\"http://my.brandoncarter.com/product/bodyweight-blast/\" target=\"_blank\"> <br />\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/10/20112101/imacright_790x926.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br />\n</a> <br />\n<a href=\"http://big.brandoncarter.com/special-offers/get-ripped-fast/\" target=\"_blank\"> <br />\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/08/02212110/fbb-boxshot.png\" alt=\"fbb-boxshot\" /> <br />\n</a>\"</p>","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-11-13 02:50:42","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-11-13 02:50:42","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-11-13 02:50:42","published_by":1},{"id":2007,"uuid":"146f7a68-7065-4571-91d2-25f1c87a7264","title":"Home","slug":"about","markdown":"[vc_row][vc_column][/vc_column][/vc_row]","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>[vc<em>row][vc</em>column][/vc<em>column][/vc</em>row]</p>","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-04-13 04:10:36","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-04-13 04:10:36","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-04-13 04:10:36","published_by":1},{"id":2008,"uuid":"cc7dcd3a-7fcf-415d-8ebf-cda27429eb74","title":"News","slug":"news","markdown":"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-04-13 04:10:36","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-04-13 04:10:36","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-04-13 04:10:36","published_by":1},{"id":2009,"uuid":"c8e52bce-7078-4ff6-9bf3-d6a2b717abde","title":"HOME BICEP WORKOUT!!!

Maybe about 70% of the weight you use for regular sets of 10. For example, being able to curl 110 pounds 10 times may require you to drop down to about 80 pounds for this particular exercise.\n\n2\nThe exercise is best described as doing 3 exercises back to back, isolating different parts of you biceps.\n\n3\nThe first movement you will be making is basically half of a curl. Have the bar at your waist and lift until your forearms are parallel to the floor, stop, lower the weight and repeat 7 times.\n\n4\nWithout rest, after your 7th rep, start in the position that you ended with in the last movement (forearms parallel to the floor) and then bring the bar to your neck, back down to the starting position and back up to your neck for 7 reps. This movement is basically the top half of the typical curl whereas the previous step was the bottom half.\n\n5\nNow you have totaled 14 reps and your biceps should be on fire but its not over yet. To complete this exercise, finish it off with 7 more full motion curls to make the total 21 reps (Hence the name). Good Luck!\n\n<strong>For best results, make sure you follow a  good total body routine and diet (you get both in <a href=\"http://highlifeworkout.com/get_ripped_fast/\">my workout plan)</a>. It may also help  to try a good fat burner like <a href=\"http://highlifeworkout.com/fat-loss-energy-supplement/\">TEA REXX</a>, it is what I use to help </strong><strong>me stay ripped.</strong>\n<p class=\"getsocial\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"http://getsocialserver.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gs1002.png\" alt=\"\" /><a title=\"Add to Facebook\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://highlifeworkout.com/2011/04/06/how-to-build-bigger-stronger-biceps-with-21s-video/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"http://getsocialserver.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gs1012.png\" alt=\"Add to Facebook\" /></a><a title=\"Add to Digg\" href=\"http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fhighlifeworkout.com%2F2011%2F04%2F06%2Fhow-to-build-bigger-stronger-biceps-with-21s-video%2F&amp;title=How%20To%20Build%20Bigger%20Stronger%20Biceps%20with%20%2221's%22%20(video)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"http://getsocialserver.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gs1022.png\" alt=\"Add to Digg\" /></a><a title=\"Add to Del.icio.us\" href=\"http://del.icio.us/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhighlifeworkout.com%2F2011%2F04%2F06%2Fhow-to-build-bigger-stronger-biceps-with-21s-video%2F&amp;title=How%20To%20Build%20Bigger%20Stronger%20Biceps%20with%20%2221's%22%20(video)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"http://getsocialserver.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gs1032.png\" alt=\"Add to Del.icio.us\" /></a><a title=\"Add to Stumbleupon\" href=\"http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhighlifeworkout.com%2F2011%2F04%2F06%2Fhow-to-build-bigger-stronger-biceps-with-21s-video%2F&amp;title=How%20To%20Build%20Bigger%20Stronger%20Biceps%20with%20%2221's%22%20(video)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"http://getsocialserver.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gs1042.png\" alt=\"Add to Stumbleupon\" /></a><a title=\"Add to Reddit\" href=\"http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhighlifeworkout.com%2F2011%2F04%2F06%2Fhow-to-build-bigger-stronger-biceps-with-21s-video%2F&amp;title=How%20To%20Build%20Bigger%20Stronger%20Biceps%20with%20%2221's%22%20(video)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"http://getsocialserver.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gs1052.png\" alt=\"Add to Reddit\" /></a><a title=\"Add to Blinklist\" href=\"http://www.blinklist.com/index.php?Action=Blink/addblink.php&amp;Description=&amp;Url=http%3A%2F%2Fhighlifeworkout.com%2F2011%2F04%2F06%2Fhow-to-build-bigger-stronger-biceps-with-21s-video%2F&amp;Title=How%20To%20Build%20Bigger%20Stronger%20Biceps%20with%20%2221's%22%20(video)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"http://getsocialserver.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gs1062.png\" alt=\"Add to Blinklist\" /></a><a title=\"Add to Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home/?status=How%20To%20Build%20Bigger%20Stronger%20Biceps%20with%20%2221'+%40+How%20To%20Build%20Bigger%20Stronger%20Biceps%20with%20%2221's%22%20(video)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"http://getsocialserver.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gs1072.png\" alt=\"Add to Twitter\" /></a><img style=\"border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"http://getsocialserver.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gs1082.png\" alt=\"Add to Technorati\" /><a title=\"Add to Yahoo Buzz\" href=\"http://buzz.yahoo.com/buzz?targetUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fhighlifeworkout.com%2F2011%2F04%2F06%2Fhow-to-build-bigger-stronger-biceps-with-21s-video%2F&amp;headline=How%20To%20Build%20Bigger%20Stronger%20Biceps%20with%20%2221's%22%20(video)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"http://getsocialserver.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gs1092.png\" alt=\"Add to Yahoo Buzz\" /></a><a title=\"Add to Newsvine\" href=\"http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhighlifeworkout.com%2F2011%2F04%2F06%2Fhow-to-build-bigger-stronger-biceps-with-21s-video%2F&amp;h=How%20To%20Build%20Bigger%20Stronger%20Biceps%20with%20%2221's%22%20(video)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"http://getsocialserver.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gs1102.png\" alt=\"Add to Newsvine\" /></a><img style=\"border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"http://getsocialserver.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gs1112.png\" alt=\"\" />.</p><p>\"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gc5gQFMFI\"></iframe>\n\n<p>How To do 21's (see video above)</p>\n\n<p>First you will need to pick a weight on a barbell or ez-curl bar that will be moderately challenging for you.

With both hands grasp barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing down) keeping your elbows tight against your body. Starting with arms straight, barbell at your upper thighs, raise the barbell towards your chest until your forearms are vertical to the floor. Lower arms slowly until fully extended. Repeat. Tips for Performing Barbell Reverse Curl By using the tips mention below will help for the muscle(s) full development by\n\nincorporating more muscle fibers per rep, thus increasing the muscle's size and strength. Practice proper form and control. Starting with this exercise, or any exercise you have not performed before, use light weight until you have the full range of movement with proper extension and contraction completed. This is important for the muscles full development.\n\nKeep elbows tight to your body. When elbow is fully flexed, the elbow should only move forward a few inches allowing the forearm to be no more than perpendicular to the floor. Keep your wrist in a lock position. Keep your wrist in a locked position throughout the movement. Move naturally throughout the movement. Move naturally throughout the movement by swaying your body slightly as you lift the barbell. Don't move weight past tension point. It's important not to curl the weight past the point where tension leaves the forearm and bicep. Use weight that allows smooth and controlled motion. This will avoid cheating which in turn will take the emphasis off the forearm. Frequent Mistakes Made While Performing Barbell Reverse Curl Performing the exercise improperly, often referred to as cheating, will not allow for the muscle and muscle fibers to be use their fullest potential, resulting in not achieving desired development of the muscle. Movement performed too fast. If movement is performed too fast, it will not allow full usage of all muscle fibers. Using too much weight. A mistake for many lifters is trying to lift too much weight. Make sure to use correct weight, without cheating, this will allow you to use proper form and full range of motion. Too much upper body movement. If you use your upper body as momentum (cheating) to help in lifting the weight you are partially defeating the lift and will not gain the muscle desired. Moving weight past tension point. If you move the weight past the tension point at top of movement, this will allow your forearm to rest, thus not allowing as mush muscular gains hoped for. Moving elbows to far forward. If elbows move to far forward this will allow the shoulders and back to lift the weight with minimal emphases put on the forearms. Elbows away from body. If elbows are away from your body you will incorporate other muscle groups such as biceps, shoulders and lats in helping with the lift, thus lessening the muscle gains this exercise was designed for. Variations of Exercise or Equipment Use for Barbell Reverse Curl A variation of a specific exercise is intended to work different subgroups of muscles, or work the same muscles in slightly different ways. There are many exercise variations to this strength exercise. Some of the variations use for reverse curl:\n\nDumbbell Reverse Curl. Dumbbell reverse curl works the same way as the barbell reverse curl but with your forearms working independently of each other. The benefit with this exercise you can either lift the dumbbells at the same time or alternate arms. This is an excellent exercise for directly targeting the forearm (Brachioadialis). Barbell Reverse Preacher Curl. Your arms work together with the reverse preacher curl and performed the same as the preacher curl except palms are facing down. The benefit with this exercise, when performed correctly, arms are lock in place when resting on the pads and eliminates using the body to help with the lift. Cable Reverse Curl. Again, this performed the same as the cable curl but with palms facing the floor. The benefit with using cables, it's easier to keep tension on the forearm throughout the movement. Lever Reverse Preacher Curl. Hold the handles with an overhand grip and curl up like you would a barbell reverse preacher curl. One of the differences about using a machine, most have handles that swivel allowing for wrist comfort, this can be beneficial if having any wrist problems. Like with the cable reverse curl this machine allows you to keep the tension on the forearm throughout the movement. Other Exercises to Compliment Barbell Reverse Curl Dumbbell Wrist Curl. With using an underhand grip and working each arm individually, dumbbell wrist curl is an excellent exercise for strengthening the wrist flexors (inner forearm). Barbell Reverse Wrist Curl. With an overhand grip the barbell reverse wrist curl works both forearms together in developing the wrist extenders (back of forearm). Barbell Wrist Curl. Barbell wrist curl is another complimentary exercise that can be use to strengthen the wrist flexors (inner forearm) using an underhand grip working both arms together. Dumbbell Seated Supination. Dumbbell Seated Supination targets and strengthens the forearm supinator. This exercise is an external rotation of the forearm resulting in the palm moving up. Dumbbell Seated Pronation. Dumbbell seated pronation targets and strengthens the forearm pronators. This exercise has an internal rotation of the forearm resulting in the palm moving down. Bottom Line on Reverse BarBell Curls Barbell reverse curl is a great weight lifting exercise for multiple muscle groups including back, neck and biceps. For this reason it is important to concentrate on your forearms as the main area of exertion. Reverse curls will help strengthen your forearms so they won't fatigue while lifting weights or be painfully worn out when performing everyday tasks like cooking, yard work and holding power tools. I prefer the\n\nreverse curl exercise to be completed during or after my biceps workout. The biceps are fatigue from their exercises therefore less likely to help the forearms in lifting the weight.\n\n<strong>For best results, make sure you follow a good total body routine and diet (you get both in <a href=\"http://highlifeworkout.com/get_ripped_fast/\">my workout plan)</a>.

Strength","slug":"kettlebell-workout-exercises-for-quadrupling-functional-strength","markdown":"Free weights, cables, and machines are what usually come to mind with respects to strength training. However, kettlebells are just as effective. In fact, they’re often favored by athletes over dumbbells because not only do they help you pack on muscle, but the strength gains actually translate over to functional applications. I’ve used kettlebells myself on a few occasions, and let me tell you, they work your muscles in a different way than traditional weights. If you have access to these so-called cannon balls with a handle, then there are some kickass kettlebell workout exercises you should incorporate into your routine.\n<h3>Kettlebell vs Dumbbell</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/24223855/2084696532_b83cbecda2_m.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2968\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/24223855/2084696532_b83cbecda2_m.jpg\" alt=\"2084696532_b83cbecda2_m\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" /></a>\n\nBefore introducing a number of kettlebell exercises, I think you should know how kettlebells differ from traditional dumbbells and why it’s worth swapping between the two from time to time. Many people who never used a kettlebell often wonder how it’s different from traditional free weights. Indeed, there are a lot of exercises where using either one would suffice.\n\nHere’s one main difference, though. Unlike dumbbells, where the weight is evenly distributed from end to end, the weight of a kettlebell is offset and unbalanced due to the handle being a lot lighter than the ball it’s attached to. The unbalanced weight could be perceived as a bad thing, but this is precisely what some kettlebell loyalists love about it. By training with an offset weight, you are conditioning for functional strength that can be applied in day-to-day activites. After all, if you’re lifting a box, a luggage, or a person, will the weight be perfectly distributed?\n\nKettlebells are also favored for momentum-based exercises, such as snatches and swings. Sure, you can perform these with a dumbbell as well, but the shape of a kettlebell provides for a more natural and less awkward grip.\n<h3>Are Kettlebells Better?</h3>\nThis is where you get different answers depending on who you ask. In my opinion, if you’re an athlete and care solely about functional strength, then kettlebells do provide a slight advantage. In this case, I would recommend training with kettlebells more often. All in all, though, I believe kettlebells are simply different rather than better than dumbbells. In any case, athlete or not, I do recommend adding kettlebell training every now and then just for the sake of training your muscles in a different way.\n<h3>Kettlebell Exercises and Workouts</h3>\nAs mentioned, kettlebells are more designed for momentum-based workouts, which target areas like the hips, lower back, and joints, thus the reason they’re beloved by combat sports athletes, powerlifters, and elite soldiers. Here is a list of exercises especially designed for the kettlebell:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Legs</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Front squat, goblet squat, goblet lunges</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Chest</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Alternating floor press, standing upper chest press</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Back</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Snatch, swing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Upper back</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Renegade rows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Abs</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Russian twist</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n\nHere is a sample kettlebell workout\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">legs</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Goblet squats or goblet lunges</td>\n<td width=\"213\">3 sets, each to failure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">chest</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Standing upper chest press</td>\n<td width=\"213\">3 sets, each to failure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Hips and lower back</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Snatches or swing</td>\n<td width=\"213\">3 sets, each to failure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Upper back</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Renegade row</td>\n<td width=\"213\">3 sets, each to failure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Abs</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Russian twist</td>\n<td width=\"213\">3 sets, each to failure</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Kettlebells for Cardio</h3>\nTo increase the intensity up a notch, you can also incorporate kettlebells into your HIIT workouts. Watch the video below to see how it’s done.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yykmeUNVII\n<h3>Give It a Shot</h3>\nIf kettlebells are available in your gym, then don’t be afraid to try them out. If you got the space in your home, consider investing in a set of kettlebells. They are a bit on the pricey end, though, and certainly a lot more expensive than a barbell and dumbbell set with adjustable plates. If you do have access to them, then I highly recommend adding kettlebell workout exercises as a companion routine for your strength training regimen.\n\nWhether training with kettlebells or free weights, you have to hit total muscle failure each and every time.

This is also an exercise that burns tons of calories and elevates your metabolism provided that you go at it with full intensity and ferocity.\n<h3>Methods of Training</h3>\nThe conventional method is to just don a pair of boxing or MMA gloves and hit a heavy bag or shadow box in the air. However, there are alternatives that work even better. If your training facility has one, you can opt to use an opponent bag. This is a freestanding bag in the shape of a person. This enables you to distinguish clear striking points and also allows you to utilize a few additional strikes, such as uppercuts.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/02210715/4253169726_2e7fded1a1_m.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3135\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/02210715/4253169726_2e7fded1a1_m.jpg\" alt=\"4253169726_2e7fded1a1_m\" width=\"240\" height=\"159\" /></a>\n\nAn even better option is to train with a live partner holding a pair of striking mitts and donning a protective vest. A partner can change the angles of the mitts to enable striking at different areas. More importantly, your partner will also move around, forcing you to keep light on the balls of your feet and move with him. Best of all, your partner can also throw a few strikes of his own. Instead of just striking, you now also have to block, duck, or weave your head out of the way while countering with strikes of your own in the process.\n\nEither of these methods provides a welcome change if your normal cardio boxing routine solely consists of heavy bag work.\n<h3>Pyramid Drill</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/02210019/19048462768_7d19d9e0ca_m-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-3134\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/02210019/19048462768_7d19d9e0ca_m-1.jpg\" alt=\"19048462768_7d19d9e0ca_m (1)\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></a>\n\nIf you do stick to a heavy bag, then one exercise to try is a pyramid kicking drill that will really push your heart rate up in no time. To do the drill, start with a roundhouse kick with one leg. Immediately switch stances and roundhouse kick with the other. Switch stances again and do two back-to-back roundhouse kicks before switching and doing two kicks with the other. Keep going back and forth, raising the number of kicks on each leg until you hit seven. Once you hit that number, you’re going to descend to six roundhouse kicks per leg, then down to five, and so on until you get back to one.</p><p>The whole drill should take about five minutes to complete.\n\nThis drill is exhausting because you’re repeatedly kicking, which takes quite a bit of energy due to the size of your leg muscles and the hip motion required. Be sure to keep your hands up at all times and not let them flail to the side. Also be sure to adhere to good kicking form.

This is also an exercise that burns tons of calories and elevates your metabolism provided that you go at it with full intensity and ferocity.  </p>\n\n<h3>Methods of Training</h3>  \n\n<p>The conventional method is to just don a pair of boxing or MMA gloves and hit a heavy bag or shadow box in the air. However, there are alternatives that work even better. If your training facility has one, you can opt to use an opponent bag. This is a freestanding bag in the shape of a person. This enables you to distinguish clear striking points and also allows you to utilize a few additional strikes, such as uppercuts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/02210715/4253169726_2e7fded1a1_m.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3135\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/02210715/4253169726_2e7fded1a1_m.jpg\" alt=\"4253169726_2e7fded1a1_m\" width=\"240\" height=\"159\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>An even better option is to train with a live partner holding a pair of striking mitts and donning a protective vest. A partner can change the angles of the mitts to enable striking at different areas. More importantly, your partner will also move around, forcing you to keep light on the balls of your feet and move with him. Best of all, your partner can also throw a few strikes of his own. Instead of just striking, you now also have to block, duck, or weave your head out of the way while countering with strikes of your own in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Either of these methods provides a welcome change if your normal cardio boxing routine solely consists of heavy bag work.  </p>\n\n<h3>Pyramid Drill</h3>  \n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/02210019/19048462768_7d19d9e0ca_m-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-3134\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/02210019/19048462768_7d19d9e0ca_m-1.jpg\" alt=\"19048462768_7d19d9e0ca_m (1)\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>If you do stick to a heavy bag, then one exercise to try is a pyramid kicking drill that will really push your heart rate up in no time. To do the drill, start with a roundhouse kick with one leg. Immediately switch stances and roundhouse kick with the other. Switch stances again and do two back-to-back roundhouse kicks before switching and doing two kicks with the other. Keep going back and forth, raising the number of kicks on each leg until you hit seven. Once you hit that number, you’re going to descend to six roundhouse kicks per leg, then down to five, and so on until you get back to one.</p><p>The whole drill should take about five minutes to complete.</p>\n\n<p>This drill is exhausting because you’re repeatedly kicking, which takes quite a bit of energy due to the size of your leg muscles and the hip motion required. Be sure to keep your hands up at all times and not let them flail to the side. Also be sure to adhere to good kicking form. By good form, this means pivoting on the non-kicking foot and letting the kicking leg swing horizontally across the target with the thighs performing the motion before letting the shin fully extend.  </p>\n\n<h3>Sample Cardio Boxing Workout</h3>  \n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Pyramid drill</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Approx. 5 minutes</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Heavy bag or opponent bag work</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds, 5 sets, 30 second rest in between</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Drill with partner holding mitts</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">1 minute, 2 sets, 30 second rest in between</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<p>The total workout comes to about 15 minutes, which is the typical length of a HIIT session.  </p>\n\n<h3>Why I Like Cardio Boxing Workouts</h3>  \n\n<p>If you keep up with my YouTube channel, then you know I have a lot of HIIT videos.

Since the bar is fixed and secured on a vertical axle, it takes the burden off your stabilizers. This means these muscles begin to wane from lack of use. Sure, your muscles will get bigger, but you won’t necessarily be functionally stronger.\n<h3>Stabilizer Muscles Explained</h3>\nMuscles can pretty much be divided into two categories: movers and stabilizers. The former is the part of mass you see when you contract your muscle and is also the part that receives the bulk of stimulation from a basic exercise movement.\n\nStabilizers, on the other hand, act as supporting muscles that keep the movers “stabilized” while performing physical activity, hence its name. The stabilizers mainly consist of muscle in the trunk, hip joint, and shoulder joint. Unsurprisingly, these are also the areas where lifters report the most injuries.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPjjKovuJfM\n<h3>Stick Mostly to Free Weights</h3>\nIt kind of sounds like I’m badmouthing exercise machines to lend support for the argument of free weights. No, this is not what I’m doing. Notice in the subtitle that I said “mostly.” I’m not crapping on machines; in fact, I use them myself every now and then especially when someone in the gym is hogging the squat or bench rack. All I’m saying is that free weights should be given more emphasis, with machines used on a more occasional basis or for the days when you feel like changing things up a bit.\n\nBy using mostly free weights, you’ll keep your stabilizers functionally strong. Speaking of functional and muscular strength, using a machine doesn’t necessarily make you stronger when you switch over to a similar exercise using free weights.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/14145054/14908001931_5ddf813678_m.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3370\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-3370\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/14145054/14908001931_5ddf813678_m.jpg\" alt=\"14908001931_5ddf813678_m\" width=\"240\" height=\"159\" /></a>\n\nDuring my early workout days, I stuck mainly to machines simply because they were safer and more convenient.

I don’t remember the exact numbers, but I think my 10 rep max for the squat on a smith machine was 245lbs, give or take 10 pounds. On a squat rack with a barbell, on the other hand, I was horrified to find out my 10 rep max was only about 190, give or take five to 10 pounds.\n\nThe point of my personal story is to prove that handling free weights is far more effective as opposed to a heavy weight secured on a fixed plane.\n<h3>The Takeaway Message</h3>\nSo what are the exercises best for muscular strength?

However, as with any other method, there is a right way and wrong way to do it. If you go about it the wrong way, then not only will your performance suffer, but so will results. Worse of all, you may lose weight alright, but it will come from muscle. Before beginning any fasted cardio program, be sure you don’t make the common mistakes others have made. This will save you a lot of frustration and prematurely abandoning the training altogether.\n<h3>Mistake #1: Not Training at a High Intensity</h3>\nScience has time and again proven the superior benefits of HIIT over traditional cardio done at a moderate pace. When you train at near maximum intensity, your body burns a higher ratio of body fat over muscle. For the most part, this is common knowledge when it comes to aerobic and weight loss. However, some people have this idea in their head that because they’re training fasted that they can somehow take it easy on their workout and still see the same results. Reality check: it doesn’t work that way.\n\nPeople by nature tend to look for a reason to ease up on their workout because regimens like HIIT are tough. They may explore the idea of fasting and convince themselves that since fasting alone helps with weight loss that they can take their foot off the pedal a bit with their cardio training. As a result, they don’t push themselves to the limit that’s required of a HIIT workout.\n\nDo these people still see results? Sure they do. They will certainly appear leaner but have a bit of muscle loss as well. To preserve muscle, you can never let up on your cardio. This means – perhaps to your dismay – that you have to go all out even if it entails training to the point of vomit-inducing failure. By easing up, you’re only training at a moderate intensity and that entails a greater ratio of weight loss from muscle.\n\nSome people also deliberately ease up on their cardio believing that high intensity training and fasting increases the risk of common symptoms associated with fasting, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and nausea. While it’s true that physical training may exacerbate these symptoms, the side effects are usually only experienced by beginners whose bodies haven’t fully adjusted to the fast. In this case, the symptoms subside within a week or two.\n<h3>Mistake #2: Training Right After Fasting Begins</h3>\nFirst thing in the morning and after a strength training workout are considered the optimal moments for doing cardio since the body will target fat tissue due to the lack of available glycogen. However, some people choose to do their cardio in the evening and sometimes even right before bed. There is really nothing wrong with this in itself, though it’s not the best time since you likely consumed meals several times in the day and have calories circulating in your body that will be burned instead of fat.\n\nWith intermittent fasting, people typically begin the fast the night before and continue until lunch the next day. For people who do their cardio at night, they might get in their exercise not long after their final meal and believe that they’re training while fasted because the workout was done within the fasting period. In other words, if the fasting period is from 8:00pm to 12:00pm, a person might do their cardio at around 9:00pm or so. Since you’re training only an hour or so after your last meal, the calories from the food is going to be expended for energy instead of your fat stores.\n\nYes, technically, you can say that you’re training while fasted because you’re in the middle of an intermittent fast, but considering that you’re only about an hour or two into it, your body is going to have plenty of calories and energy from digested food that it will burn off before it resorts to your fat tissue.\n\nBy all means, get in your HIIT workout at night if that’s the only time you can squeeze it in. However, be sure then to begin your fast much earlier. At a minimum, you should wait at least four hours between your last meal and your cardio workout.\n<h3>Mistake #3: Not Drinking Enough Water</h3>\nFasting or not, you should be consuming plenty of water. This becomes especially important right before a fasted training. The side effects of dehydration are similar to those of fasting for someone who may not be accustomed to the feeling. This could hamper your performance, leading to diminished results.\n\nContrary to popular belief, fasting alone, for the most part, does not inhibit physical performance, or at least not for someone who has been fasting for some time. Dehydration, on the other hand, has been shown in <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v57/n2s/full/1601897a.html\">studies</a> to reduce physical output. Water also keeps hunger at bay, so that’s another reason to drink up if you’re feeling the effects of an empty stomach.\n\nWhen fasting, always keep a bottle of water within arm’s reach. The same applies when doing HIIT. You’ll be sweating a lot and losing a lot of fluids, so have some water close by and take a sip during your 20 second breaks.\n<h3>Mistake #4: Consuming an Energy Drink Before Workout</h3>\nSome people chug down a Red Bull or Monster about half an hour before their workout. With the high caffeine content, they will definitely feel amped up by the time their training session begins.  There’s only one problem with this: energy drinks also contain sugar. Sugar equals calories, which means you no longer have an empty stomach. With all of that sugar you just consumed, your body has a readily supply of energy it can burn off, so it will have no reason to burn your fat stores.\n\nMany people who train while fasted gulp down an energy drink without even thinking twice about this. They seem to have the idea that energy drinks are not food. However, anything that contains calories constitutes as food.\n\nGranted, there are sugar-free varieties with zero calories and even those 5-Hour Energy shots, but those are loaded with artificial sweeteners and other unnatural preservatives. If you need a natural energy boost, then there are several options. You can have a cup of pure black coffee, or you can take a caffeine pill. Better yet, you can take a pre-workout supplement like <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/rebellion-explosive-pre-workout/\">Rebellion</a> or a fat burner like <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/tea-rexx/\">Tea Rexx</a>, both of which contain caffeine and other ingredients proven for amping you up. Best of all, these supplements are calorie-free, making them ideal if you want to reap the most out of your fasted training.\n<h3>Mistake #5: Doing Fasted Cardio Without Having Done Either Before</h3>\nIf you have never fasted before, then don’t do HIIT on your first fasting day. The reverse is true as well; if you normally fast but seldom do any form of cardio work, don’t fast on your first day of training. Either of these can be alien to the body, and you don’t know how it’s going to respond. You need to start out slow and be cognizant of any discomfort you may feel. If you jump right into fasted cardio and are new to fasting, cardio, or both, then you risk injury or having a bad first day that may discourage you from continuing.\n\nWhen starting out, fasting and cardio should be done independently of one another. Once your body becomes accustomed to fasting and the intensity level of HIIT, then feel free to combine the two. Take as much time as you need to become comfortable with each modality.\n\nHere’s a good rule of thumb to follow: refrain from doing fasted cardio until you can complete a full 16-hour fast and are able to complete a full 15-20 minute HIIT session without modifying the workout (e.g. increasing rest time, shortening exercise duration, etc.).\n<h3>Mistake #6: Not Taking a BCAA</h3>\nOne of the biggest myths out there about fasting is that it burns muscle. This is actually only true if fasting is done to the extreme and lasting for days. With Intermittent fasting, you almost never go for more than 24 hours.\n\nAs for cardio burning muscle, there’s some grey area here since it depends on the type of cardio. Aerobics done the typical way, such as a steady-paced jog, is notorious for eating into muscle tissue. HIIT on the other hand, tips the ratio in your favor with respects to fat to muscle burned.\n\nWhat about fasted cardio, or more specifically, fasted HIIT? Most of the calories burned will be from fat stores, but nothing is ever 100%, so there is always a risk of losing some muscle. Even minimal muscle loss, though, can be quite disheartening especially for men who bust their balls to break plateaus and acquire lean mass. This is where a BCAA supplement comes in. You likely already know that BCAAs compose of three of the most essential amino acids, so no need to explain what they are. Most people, though, are not entirely clear on its use and often wonder why BCAAs are even necessary when they are found abundantly in protein-based foods.\n\nBCAAs are valuable for promoting protein synthesis and reducing the rate of protein breakdown, which occurs during strenuous exercise. In essence, they counteract the effects of any muscle breakdown that may occur from fasted training. This pertains to both HIIT and strength training. Some people only think BCAAs are necessary when it comes to fasted strength training, but it’s also required when doing workouts like HIIT, especially when exercises utilize quick and explosive muscle movements like sprints or burpees.\n\nThere’s still the question, though, of why not just taking a whey protein supplement. As was talked about earlier when discussing energy drinks, whey protein, much like a can of Red Bull, has calories, and therefore constitutes as food. If you take a scoop of whey before training, then you’re no longer exercising on an empty stomach. While BCAAs do contain some calories, the amount is miniscule.\n\nIt’s recommended that you take a BCAA supplement like <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/revolt/\">Revolt</a> about 30 minutes before beginning a fasted HIIT session. The product also contains caffeine, so you’ll have plenty of energy to push through the rigorous nature of the workout.\n<h3>Mistake #7: Reducing Cardio Sessions</h3>\nThis is similar to the first mistake about people lessening the intensity. Just as some no longer train as hard, others reduce their weekly number of HIIT sessions. Regardless, the mentality is often the same: since they’re incorporating the benefits of fasting, they think that somehow it’s a valid reason to skip a few HIIT workouts here and there.\n\nWhile fasting and cardio complement one another, the presence of one is not an excuse to let up on the other. If your fat loss routine includes three weekly sessions of HIIT, then it’s not okay all of a sudden to just do one or two and still expect the same results.\n\nPeople by nature tend to look for excuses that enable them to get the same while doing less. People also tend to believe they can ease up on their workout because they are now using the latest “breakthrough” supplement, or because they purchased a new piece of workout equipment seen on an infomercial. It just doesn’t work this way; if you want real results, then there is no way around strenuous physical workouts.\n<h3>Mistake # 8: Doing Fasted Cardio too Often</h3>\nAt the other end of the spectrum is increasing the number of fasted HIIT sessions. When it comes to exercise, you have to find a happy medium; doing too much can be as equally counterproductive as doing too little. Always listen to your body; if you feel pooped for longer than usual or if your physical performance has been diminishing, then you need to give yourself a break. When combined with fasting, excessive cardio, even if it’s the good kind like HIIT, can be catabolic. Sure, you may burn extra calories from the extra sessions, but your metabolism can only elevate to a certain threshold.\n\nRemember this: with fasted cardio, you will see better and faster results. It doesn’t mean, though, that you will lose 30 pounds of pure body fat by the end of the week. Your goals still need to be realistic, and doing more won’t accelerate the results.\n<h3>Make Fasted Cardio a Routine Norm</h3>\nPeople are just beginning to catch onto the benefits of fasted training even though the method isn’t new by any stretch of the means. Fasted cardio, though, has been tainted with half-truths and ideas that are just flat out false. You have to distinguish the facts from the myths before diving into this form of training. It’s all about knowledge before practice.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Getting in your cardio while in a fasted state has long been a proven technique for accelerating fat loss. However, as with any other method, there is a right way and wrong way to do it. If you go about it the wrong way, then not only will your performance suffer, but so will results. Worse of all, you may lose weight alright, but it will come from muscle. Before beginning any fasted cardio program, be sure you don’t make the common mistakes others have made. This will save you a lot of frustration and prematurely abandoning the training altogether.  </p>\n\n<h3>Mistake #1: Not Training at a High Intensity</h3>  \n\n<p>Science has time and again proven the superior benefits of HIIT over traditional cardio done at a moderate pace. When you train at near maximum intensity, your body burns a higher ratio of body fat over muscle. For the most part, this is common knowledge when it comes to aerobic and weight loss. However, some people have this idea in their head that because they’re training fasted that they can somehow take it easy on their workout and still see the same results. Reality check: it doesn’t work that way.</p>\n\n<p>People by nature tend to look for a reason to ease up on their workout because regimens like HIIT are tough. They may explore the idea of fasting and convince themselves that since fasting alone helps with weight loss that they can take their foot off the pedal a bit with their cardio training. As a result, they don’t push themselves to the limit that’s required of a HIIT workout.</p>\n\n<p>Do these people still see results? Sure they do. They will certainly appear leaner but have a bit of muscle loss as well. To preserve muscle, you can never let up on your cardio. This means – perhaps to your dismay – that you have to go all out even if it entails training to the point of vomit-inducing failure. By easing up, you’re only training at a moderate intensity and that entails a greater ratio of weight loss from muscle.</p>\n\n<p>Some people also deliberately ease up on their cardio believing that high intensity training and fasting increases the risk of common symptoms associated with fasting, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and nausea.

Of course, some amino acids play a bigger role than others, hence why they are sold in supplement form. Leucine is one such AA. Even among branched chain amino acids, which make up the “big three” AAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), leucine is considered the most valuable of the trio.

If you want to learn everything you need to know about fasted training, read this article!</h3>\nFasted training has long been a controversial topic within the fitness community. Some swear by it, while others are skeptical, claiming that there is simply too much risk for muscle catabolism.\n\nFasted training is certainly a nice way to change things up if your existing routine is no longer yielding results or starting to get boring. Before you begin, though, there are a few things you ought to know about this increasingly popular method of training for fat loss.\n<h3>Fasted Training; What Does It Mean?</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01110005/Fotolia_65297703_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"Dumbbells on a rack\" />\n\nWhen you train fasted, <strong>you are simply exercising while having eaten nothing at all for a good half of the day or so</strong>. There’s no specific number of hours you have to let pass before your workout can be considered a fasted training, though it should be more than the usual number of hours you go between meals. If you train first thing in the morning before breakfast, that certainly constitutes as fasted training since your body went for an entire night without eating while the body slept.\n\nSome people consider working out at least four hours after their last meal to be fasted training. Again, there is no specified minimum number of hours that has to pass, though ideally it should be much longer than a mere four hours.\n<h3>The Idea Behind Fasted Training</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01110005/Fotolia_71097097_Subscription_XXL--1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"What was that?\" />\n\nSo why is fasted training gaining so much traction as of late? The support is rooted in science. When you exercise, or do any type of physical activity for that matter, your body burns energy (calories). If there is stored glycogen (converted mainly from the carbs you eat) from foods you have eaten just a few hours ago or less, then that will be the first source to be used for energy.\n\nWhen you fast or wake up after a full eight hour sleep, your body has very low glycogen levels. When you exercise when the gas tank is empty, then the body has to rely on its reserves, which in this case, is in the form of stored triglycerides in your adipose fat cells. <strong>Fancy words aside, your body starts to burn fat for fuel!</strong>\n\nThis is the underlying principle behind fasted training, and there is ample evidence, such as in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23340006\">study</a>, that validates the idea of training on an empty stomach. The study <strong>showed that subjects who trained while skipping breakfast lost 20% more body fat than their breakfast-eating counterparts.</strong>\n<h3>The Argument Against It</h3>\nSome trainers, though, rail against the idea, pointing out that with fasted training also comes the risk of muscle loss. The people who fall in this camp are not entirely wrong. When the body is depleted of glycogen, it will resort to its fat stores for energy but may also grab what little bits of energy it can from muscle.\n\nSuch concerns are certainly justifiable. No one, after all, wants to lose lean muscle mass. Too much muscle loss, after all, is often responsible for the dreaded skinny-fat physique.\n\nThe million dollar question is: does fasted training burn muscle? Well, it’s actually kind of a yes and no, <strong>though it’s mostly a no if you do it the right way</strong>. It actually lies more on the type of training you’re doing rather than the fasting itself.\n\nWhen it comes to cardio, you should be doing high-intensity exercises and not the far more conventional aerobics that often entail a 30-45 minute jog or use of the StairMaster. This applies regardless of whether or not you’re training in a fasted state.\n\n<strong>High pace cardio like HIIT is far more efficient at targeting body fat</strong>, whereas traditional cardio is notorious for eating into muscle especially if done for long stretches.\n\nIf you’re skeptical about this, then just take a look at the near skin-and-bones physique of marathon runners. Sure, they’re lean and thin, but not in a healthy and desirable looking way.\n\nSome people who have done fasted cardio utilize long-endurance training. When they began noticing that their muscles were atrophying at slow but noticeable levels, they attributed it as a consequence of fasted training when it was really the poor choice of cardio that’s the culprit.\n<h3>What About Fasted Strength Training?</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01110005/Fotolia_95565095_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"young nerd try to lift weights.\" />\n\nAt this point, everything that has been discussed so far about fasted training pertained to cardio. Well, what about resistance training? Fasted strength training is actually even more controversial and is even shunned by many certified and seasoned coaches.\n\nThese people do bring up a valid point; it is true that after a certain period of fasting, the body will begin turning to muscle for energy to preserve the remaining fat stores. However, this only occurs when fasting is prolonged way beyond the 16 hours typical of an intermittent fasting period.\n\nBy “beyond,” we’re talking about days and even near the approximate three-week duration that the human body is able to go without food.\n\nSeveral studies have actually debunked the notion that intermittent fasted strength training is catabolic to muscle. Fasting, in fact, <strong>has been shown to dramatically elevate growth hormones in both men and women</strong>.\n\nNevertheless, the possibility of muscle protein breakdown does exist, so concerns about this aren’t completely unfounded. <strong>Fortunately, the risks can be mitigated by taking a BCAA supplement about 30 minutes before exercising</strong>.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>By taking a BCAA like <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/revolt/\">Revolt</a>, you’ll have three essential amino acids (but mainly leucine) needed for keeping the body in a positive state of protein synthesis, and thereby preventing amino acids from breaking down and being converted into energy.</strong>.</p><p>\nOn a final note regarding fasted weight training, it’s recommended that you consume food following your workout, or at the very least, a serving of whey protein.\n\nIf you train to absolute failure like you’re supposed to be doing, then your muscles are going to be physically damaged, which will be sending the cells into repair mode. Be sure you get enough protein and calories to provide the cells with the macronutrients needed to carry out the recovery process.\n\nFor this reason, it’s recommended that you begin your strength training about an hour before your fasting session ends. This way, you get in a meal without having to cut your fasting period short.\n<h3>Fasted Training Schedule</h3>\nSo you decided that fasted training sounds promising. The next step is putting it into practice. There really is no right or wrong way of doing it, though here are a few pointers to help you get started on the right track.\n\nAs far as fasting goes, the process should last for 16 hours, during which you don’t consume anything other than water or other non-caloric beverages like unsweetened tea and coffee. The easiest way to get in the 16 hours is to follow the “lazy man’s” method. Basically, just stop eating after dinner, skip breakfast the next morning, and don’t eat anything until lunch.\n\nThis should add up to about 16 hours. If it doesn’t, then push your last meal to an hour or so earlier or delay lunch by an hour. To train while fasted, you can simply get your exercise in first thing in the morning or any time before your first meal.\n<h3>How Often Should You Fast?</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01110005/Fotolia_36543754_Subscription_Monthly_L-1024x710.jpg\" alt=\"Lunch time concept\" />\n\nInstead of multiple, 16-hour fasts, some people also choose to fast once a week for a full 24 hours, or go for a full day eating only one small meal. This is adequate as well. There are also those who may go on a fruit fast where they may only have one piece of fruit for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Feel free to give this a try as well if you feel it’s right up your alley.\n\nHere is what a fast day would look like if you began your fast at 8:00pm the night before:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">7:00am</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Bed rise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">8:00am</td>\n<td width=\"319\">HIIT training</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">12:00pm</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Lunch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">3:00pm</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Midday meal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">6:30pm</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Dinner</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">9:00pm</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Evening snack (final meal of the day)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">10:00pm</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Bed time</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nIn the sample above, if you were to fast again the next day, then you would scratch off the evening snack at 9:00pm, thus making dinner the final meal of the day.\n\nHere is another sample day if you were to fast on a strength training day. This one has a full meal plan included as well. Once again, the fasting begins at 8:00pm the night before. It also assumes that you plan on fasting the next day\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">7:00am</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Bed rise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">11:00am</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Strength training workout</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">12:00pm</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Lunch/post-workout meal\n\nOne cup whole milk, one scoop whey protein, lean ham and cheddar sandwich on whole wheat bread, homemade avocado sauce, one fruit, steamed vegetables – 1,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">2:00pm</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2<sup>nd</sup> meal\n\nOne cup milk, one scoop whey protein, ½ cup oatmeal, one serving nuts and almonds – 500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">4:00pm</td>\n<td width=\"319\">3<sup>rd</sup> meal\n\nOne cup milk, one scoop whey protein, one fruit, ½ whole wheat bagel w/ peanut butter spread – 500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">7:00pm</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Dinner/last meal of the day\n\nOne cup milk, one scoop casein protein, lean steak on whole wheat tortilla, ½ avocado, extra virgin olive oil dip, steamed vegetables – 500/600 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">10:00pm</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Bed time</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nOf course, this is just a sample, and the exact number of calories may be different for you depending on various factors, such as whether you’re in a muscle building or fat loss phase.\n\nFor the most part, this plan is really no different than what you would normally do on a regular strength training day. The only difference is that you’re skipping the pre-workout meal.\n<h3>A Note About Your Eating Window</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Intermittent-Fasting-What-Is-It-and-What-Does-It-Do-To-Your-Testosterone-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Muscular man sitting at the table with empty plate\" />\n\nIf you fast for 16 hours, then that gives you an eight hour feeding window. While fasted training is a great way to burn additional calories and release hormones conducive for fat loss, remember that you still have to create a calorie deficit.\n\nThis means that you still have to be careful with what and how much you eat during that brief feeding window. If on a fat loss, then your total consumed calories still have to be lower than what you would normally consume.\n\nIf you’re on a muscle building phase, then you have to eat more. In this instance, it may mean eating larger meals to compensate for the shorter window. Some fitness trainers to avoid larger meals in one sitting, but eating larger meals in a shorter period may not be such a bad thing after all.\n\nIn one <a href=\"http://fitness.mercola.com/sites/fitness/archive/2013/03/01/daily-intermittent-fasting.aspx\">study</a>, mice that underwent an intermittent fast (and therefore a shorter feeding window) exhibited better overall health and vitals despite consuming the same number of calories as mice that were fed at regular intervals.\n<h3>Potential Side Effects of Fasted Training</h3>\nPeople respond differently to different stimulus. Some people may be able to dive straight into fasted training and perform just as well, if not better than they normally do when training in a fed state. For others, however, there may be an adjustment period as their body attunes itself to the sensations of training on an empty stomach.\n\nFor these people, they may experience some unpleasant sensations in the beginning, such as nausea, dizziness, or seeing eye floaters. Whatever the case may be, if you feel any form of discomfort, stop immediately.\n\nMost likely, your body just isn’t use to it. <strong>Any side effect you may feel should gradually dissipate as your body adapts</strong>. In the beginning, take it slowly and be especially cognizant of any bodily sensations.\n\n<em>Do you feel weaker, or like you’re exerting more to acquire the same output in your previous workouts?</em> Don’t worry if in your first workout you’re unable to exercise at the same intensity. Just start from where you are and work your way up.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A pre-workout supplement like <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/rebellion/\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a>, or BCAA supplement like <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/revolt/\" target=\"_blank\">Revolt</a>, or both, should help get your performance back up, so don’t ignore supplementation.</strong>.</p><p>\n\n<h3>Break Plateaus With Fasted Training</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01110005/Fotolia_79318888_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x674.jpg\" alt=\"Young exhausted weightlifting girl after training\" />\n\nMore people are giving fasted training a shot, and it’s not because it’s the latest fitness fad. The results speak for themselves, and many people from world-class athletes to the average Joe and Jane have experienced firsthand the transformation that is evident when they take before and after photos.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Due to the demands fasted training places on the body, be sure to supplement with <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/revolt/\">Revolt</a> to supply your body with some much needed BCAAs. </strong>.</p><p>\nThis will provide your muscles with fuel for your fasted workout and ensure that you are ONLY using fat for fuel, and not muscle!","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Training fasted is quickly becoming one of the most effective ways to burn belly fat.

Some fitness trainers to avoid larger meals in one sitting, but eating larger meals in a shorter period may not be such a bad thing after all.</p>\n\n<p>In one <a href=\"http://fitness.mercola.com/sites/fitness/archive/2013/03/01/daily-intermittent-fasting.aspx\">study</a>, mice that underwent an intermittent fast (and therefore a shorter feeding window) exhibited better overall health and vitals despite consuming the same number of calories as mice that were fed at regular intervals.  </p>\n\n<h3>Potential Side Effects of Fasted Training</h3>  \n\n<p>People respond differently to different stimulus.

Whatever the case may be, if you feel any form of discomfort, stop immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Most likely, your body just isn’t use to it. <strong>Any side effect you may feel should gradually dissipate as your body adapts</strong>.

However, you do need to show up when it’s time to train and not make up an excuse. Consistency is a huge part, but there’s more. Your workouts also have to be structured and executed in a manner that primes the body for fat loss. The following workout strategies are not just theories; they are methods grounded in science and utilized by people like yourself with real-world results.\n<h3>Workout Strategy #1: Nothing Beats HIIT</h3>\nYou may already know this, but to lose fat, you have to sweat and sweat a lot. Sure, you can break a sweat from running on a treadmill for 30 minutes, but that’s far from the ideal way of losing fat. You will definitely lose weight; that’s for sure. However, some of the weight will be from muscle, definitely not what you want regardless if you’re male or female but especially if the former.\n\nThe single best piece of advice with respects to cardio for fat loss is to train to near your maximum intensity. The specific exercise you do is secondary; what matters is that you go all out. This means you should be panting heavily even after just 30 seconds. Obviously, you’re not even close to working out at high intensity if you can maintain the training pace for 30 minutes or more. Adhere to the 30 second rule: if you’re not breathing heavily after 30 seconds, then you’re not training hard enough.\n\nYou probably don’t need a lengthy introduction to High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT); just know that this type of workout delivers the intensity (hence its name) needed for the body to target its fat stores instead of eating into muscle.\n\nOf course, there are dozens of variations of HIIT, but the underlying principle is the same. You exercise at maximum intensity for 30 seconds, give or take 10 seconds, and rest for the same length of time before beginning the next set. Rinse and repeat until you exercised for a total of 15 to 20 minutes. That’s all there is to it; it’s simple, but by no means easy.\n\nThis <a href=\"https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/HIITvsCardio.html\">study</a> from the University of New Mexico verifies the efficacy of HIIT compared to traditional steady-state cardio.\n\nHIIT is also beneficial in the sense that there’s more room for variety. With steady-state cardio, you’re just going through the same motion for 30-45 minutes. Since HIIT is composed of short bursts of 30-second exercises, you can mix and match whatever exercises you prefer provided that they’re intense enough to induce heavy breathing. A few good exercises to consider incorporating include:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sprinting</li>\n\t<li>Box jumps</li>\n\t<li>Burpees</li>\n\t<li>Clapping pushups</li>\n\t<li>Isometric pushups</li>\n\t<li>Isometric wall sit</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Workout Strategy #2: Train First Thing in the Morning</h3>\nIf there’s a method more effective than HIIT, it’s HIIT first thing in the morning. When it comes to cardio, timing is grossly underestimated. Too many people train whenever it’s convenient. If time is a constraint, then how about getting out of bed half an hour earlier? Sure, people value their Zs, but there is tremendous benefit in working out on an empty stomach.\n\nThe body is a complex mechanism that requires energy whenever it performs a physical movement. This is true whether you’re executing a heavy barbell squat or lifting your finger to scratch your nose. So where does the body get the energy? It gets it from the foods you eat, though it can also rely on your fatty tissue or muscle as a backup reserve if you haven’t eaten anything in the last few hours. This is actually what you want the body to do, to rely on its reserve, but from as much fatty tissue as possible and not on muscle.\n\nWhen you get out of bed, you just fasted for the entire night. That’s about eight hours or more without eating. This means there are no macronutrients circulating in your blood that your body can expend for energy. If you physically exert yourself to the max as you will with HIIT, then the body will have no choice but to rely on the fatty tissue that store fat around your troubled spots, such as your midsection, chest, thighs, and upper arms.\n\nSo what is the minimum number of hours it takes for food to completely digest? This depends on various factors, such as the type of food you consumed, its macronutrient makeup, your genetics, etc. A commonly accepted timeframe is around six to eight hours, though it may be as few as four and as long as 12 hours.\n\nAs long as you train first thing in the morning after a full night’s sleep, then you should be alright. If you must train at any other time, then try to wait at least four hours, though this is the absolute minimum. However, there really is no reason why you can’t make time for HIIT first thing in the morning by waking up half an hour earlier.\n<h3>Workout Strategy #3: Be Sure to Up the Intensity Each and Every Time</h3>\nIf you can bench press 200 pounds for 10 reps, do you continue to use that same weight and do the same number of reps each time you bench press? Of course, not; you get stronger and more muscular by pushing yourself to do more reps or raising the weight. It’s the same with cardio; if you want to continue to drop the pounds from pure body fat, then you have to continue to up the intensity as you become more fit.\n\nWith HIIT, there are multiple ways to raise difficulty. One way is to increase the exercise duration. You can also decrease rest time. A combination of both is probably best to ensure that the total workout time stays within 15-20 minute.\n\nYet another way is to make the exercises more difficult. Exercises can always be made harder. Take the basic sprint, for instance. How might you be able to make it harder? Here are a few ways:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Wear a weighted vest</li>\n\t<li>Wear a high altitude mask</li>\n\t<li>Wear a parachute vest</li>\n\t<li>Sprint uphill</li>\n\t<li>Sprint on a sandy surface (you’ll be surprised at how much harder this is)</li>\n</ul>\nHow can you raise the difficulty for burpees, clapping pushups, and other HIIT exercises? Keep a workout journal and log every exercise you do, including the duration and any special conditions you added to make it harder.\n<h3>Workout Strategy #4: Change the Exercises</h3>\nIt was mentioned earlier how it’s easier to stay motivated with HIIT due to the ability to change up the exercises. It’s highly recommended that you do just that every several weeks. The thing about the human body is that it’s very adaptable. Once it becomes adapted to a certain stressor from a certain workout, such as bench presses, then the muscles will seize to grow even if you continue to raise repetitions or add more weights. It’s the same way with cardio. Fat loss will seize, and you will find yourself right in a plateau if you continue to use the same exercises in the same order.\n\nBy changing the exercises, this implies more than just making a few modifications. In other words, if pushups is one of the exercises, widening the placement of your hands does not constitute changing the exercise. By change, this means doing a whole new exercise completely. Swapping out sprints for cardio boxing, for instance, constitutes a real changeup.\n\nThis is precisely why most trainers and coaches advocate for the muscle confusion principle. By continually alternating your routine, your body is kept “guessing,” for the lack of a better term. Since the body is consistently in a state of having to adjust to a new exercise paradigm, it will have to adapt by becoming stronger, and thereby creating new muscle fibers or elevating metabolism.\n\nOn a final note, while you’re changing exercises, you still need to stick to HIIT. Some people get the idea that switching exercises mean that they can temporarily swap out HIIT for traditional cardio. Some people may do this simply because they want a break from the intensity of HIIT or because they have done steady-state cardio in the past and have developed a love affair with it. While you need to switch exercises, you always need to stay within the HIIT paradigm; no exception.\n<h3>Workout Strategy #5: Don’t Neglect Strength Training</h3>\nWait a minute; this is a fat loss post. Why is strength training being brought up? Here’s the deal, even if you’re not particularly interested in packing on solid muscle mass, you should still get in a strength training session two to three times a week.\n\nIf you stick to compound movements and train until you cannot do another rep, then your body is going to burn even more calories, not to mention that resting metabolism rate will go up, as was shown in this <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/11283427\">study</a>.\n\nResistance training also means increase in lean muscle mass, which in turn helps you burn even more fat. Even for females who may not desire additional muscle mass, a small gain is a good thing because it will increase definition, not to mention it will also elevate metabolism since muscle requires energy (and therefore calorie expenditure) to maintain. This will help you achieve that “toned” look that people often and mistakenly attribute to spot reduction exercises. Spot reducing has been debunked time and again; it’s simply wishful thinking. Here’s one <a href=\"http://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/spot-reduction-one-final-attempt-to-kill-the-myth\">study</a> that proves so in case you’re still hoping against hope that it’s possible.\n\nTo put on lean mass, make compound exercises the bulk of your strength training. Forget about the bicep curls and tricep pulldowns you see people doing in the gym. Those are isolation movements and will barely scratch the surface. Make exercises like low volume squats, bench presses, and dead lifts a staple part of your resistance training. By low volume, this means using heavy weights that will have you reaching failure within 5-6 reps.\n<h3>Workout Strategy #6: Warm Up Before Beginning a Workout</h3>\nToo often, people dive right into their workout when their muscles are still “cold.” This is akin to starting your car and immediately putting it into gear without taking a minute for the engine to warm up. You have to warm up your muscles first. Doing so opens up the blood vessels and increases blood flow by as much as 75%. Increased blood flow means more oxygen shuttled to your muscles and lungs, thus translating to better physical performance. As was mentioned, to lose fat, you have to train at your absolute best, and better blood flow helps you train at your peak.\n\nIn addition, warming up not only increases physical performance but also reduces chances of pulling a muscle and injuring yourself. This was proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3849057\">study</a>.\n\nSo what is the proper way to warm up? There really is no right or wrong way, but a good method is to simply do the same exercises you’ll be doing during your actual workout but at a moderate pace, about half of your maximum intensity sounds about right. If you were going to sprint, for example, then consider jogging at a moderate pace for one lap. Likewise, if you can squat 200 pounds for 10 reps, then a warm up may consist of a 10-rep squat using a 100-pound barbell.\n<h3>Workout Strategy #7: Take a Performance Enhancing Supplement</h3>\nJust because you shouldn’t eat before a HIIT workout doesn’t mean you should ignore supplementation. Exercising on an empty stomach may or may not inhibit your performance. Either way, though, you should consume a pre-workout formula to help give you a booster. <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/rebellion-explosive-pre-workout/\">Rebellion</a> is one such supplement with ingredients proven to enhance physical performance. This includes caffeine and L-citrulline malate. The latter is known to increase arginine production, which in turn increases nitric oxide (NO) production. As with warming up, increased NO increases blood flow, and therefore, more oxygen to muscles being pushed to their limit.\n\nIs a pre-workout supplement absolutely necessary? No. Supplements are actually a smaller part of the equation compared to the grander scheme of things. However, the ingredients have been proven to give you the push you need to go that extra mile. It’s that extra mile that makes the difference between great and mediocre results.\n<h3>Train Like You Mean It</h3>\nThere’s so much more to losing fat than just exercising. The type of workout, the timing, how hard you push yourself, and a multitude of other factors all matter.

Here are a few ways:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n    <li>Wear a weighted vest</li>\n    <li>Wear a high altitude mask</li>\n    <li>Wear a parachute vest</li>\n    <li>Sprint uphill</li>\n    <li>Sprint on a sandy surface (you’ll be surprised at how much harder this is)</li>\n</ul>  \n\n<p>How can you raise the difficulty for burpees, clapping pushups, and other HIIT exercises? Keep a workout journal and log every exercise you do, including the duration and any special conditions you added to make it harder.  </p>\n\n<h3>Workout Strategy #4: Change the Exercises</h3>  \n\n<p>It was mentioned earlier how it’s easier to stay motivated with HIIT due to the ability to change up the exercises. It’s highly recommended that you do just that every several weeks. The thing about the human body is that it’s very adaptable. Once it becomes adapted to a certain stressor from a certain workout, such as bench presses, then the muscles will seize to grow even if you continue to raise repetitions or add more weights. It’s the same way with cardio. Fat loss will seize, and you will find yourself right in a plateau if you continue to use the same exercises in the same order.</p>\n\n<p>By changing the exercises, this implies more than just making a few modifications. In other words, if pushups is one of the exercises, widening the placement of your hands does not constitute changing the exercise. By change, this means doing a whole new exercise completely. Swapping out sprints for cardio boxing, for instance, constitutes a real changeup.</p>\n\n<p>This is precisely why most trainers and coaches advocate for the muscle confusion principle. By continually alternating your routine, your body is kept “guessing,” for the lack of a better term. Since the body is consistently in a state of having to adjust to a new exercise paradigm, it will have to adapt by becoming stronger, and thereby creating new muscle fibers or elevating metabolism.</p>\n\n<p>On a final note, while you’re changing exercises, you still need to stick to HIIT. Some people get the idea that switching exercises mean that they can temporarily swap out HIIT for traditional cardio. Some people may do this simply because they want a break from the intensity of HIIT or because they have done steady-state cardio in the past and have developed a love affair with it. While you need to switch exercises, you always need to stay within the HIIT paradigm; no exception.  </p>\n\n<h3>Workout Strategy #5: Don’t Neglect Strength Training</h3>  \n\n<p>Wait a minute; this is a fat loss post. Why is strength training being brought up? Here’s the deal, even if you’re not particularly interested in packing on solid muscle mass, you should still get in a strength training session two to three times a week.</p>\n\n<p>If you stick to compound movements and train until you cannot do another rep, then your body is going to burn even more calories, not to mention that resting metabolism rate will go up, as was shown in this <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/11283427\">study</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Resistance training also means increase in lean muscle mass, which in turn helps you burn even more fat. Even for females who may not desire additional muscle mass, a small gain is a good thing because it will increase definition, not to mention it will also elevate metabolism since muscle requires energy (and therefore calorie expenditure) to maintain. This will help you achieve that “toned” look that people often and mistakenly attribute to spot reduction exercises. Spot reducing has been debunked time and again; it’s simply wishful thinking. Here’s one <a href=\"http://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/spot-reduction-one-final-attempt-to-kill-the-myth\">study</a> that proves so in case you’re still hoping against hope that it’s possible.</p>\n\n<p>To put on lean mass, make compound exercises the bulk of your strength training. Forget about the bicep curls and tricep pulldowns you see people doing in the gym. Those are isolation movements and will barely scratch the surface. Make exercises like low volume squats, bench presses, and dead lifts a staple part of your resistance training. By low volume, this means using heavy weights that will have you reaching failure within 5-6 reps.  </p>\n\n<h3>Workout Strategy #6: Warm Up Before Beginning a Workout</h3>  \n\n<p>Too often, people dive right into their workout when their muscles are still “cold.” This is akin to starting your car and immediately putting it into gear without taking a minute for the engine to warm up. You have to warm up your muscles first. Doing so opens up the blood vessels and increases blood flow by as much as 75%. Increased blood flow means more oxygen shuttled to your muscles and lungs, thus translating to better physical performance. As was mentioned, to lose fat, you have to train at your absolute best, and better blood flow helps you train at your peak.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, warming up not only increases physical performance but also reduces chances of pulling a muscle and injuring yourself. This was proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3849057\">study</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So what is the proper way to warm up? There really is no right or wrong way, but a good method is to simply do the same exercises you’ll be doing during your actual workout but at a moderate pace, about half of your maximum intensity sounds about right. If you were going to sprint, for example, then consider jogging at a moderate pace for one lap. Likewise, if you can squat 200 pounds for 10 reps, then a warm up may consist of a 10-rep squat using a 100-pound barbell.  </p>\n\n<h3>Workout Strategy #7: Take a Performance Enhancing Supplement</h3>  \n\n<p>Just because you shouldn’t eat before a HIIT workout doesn’t mean you should ignore supplementation. Exercising on an empty stomach may or may not inhibit your performance. Either way, though, you should consume a pre-workout formula to help give you a booster. <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/rebellion-explosive-pre-workout/\">Rebellion</a> is one such supplement with ingredients proven to enhance physical performance. This includes caffeine and L-citrulline malate. The latter is known to increase arginine production, which in turn increases nitric oxide (NO) production. As with warming up, increased NO increases blood flow, and therefore, more oxygen to muscles being pushed to their limit.</p>\n\n<p>Is a pre-workout supplement absolutely necessary? No. Supplements are actually a smaller part of the equation compared to the grander scheme of things. However, the ingredients have been proven to give you the push you need to go that extra mile. It’s that extra mile that makes the difference between great and mediocre results.  </p>\n\n<h3>Train Like You Mean It</h3>  \n\n<p>There’s so much more to losing fat than just exercising. The type of workout, the timing, how hard you push yourself, and a multitude of other factors all matter.

So, what’s the verdict on one of bodybuilding’s longest and most controversial subjects?\n<h3>It’s Somewhat Possible, but Don’t Count on It</h3>\nWhen it comes to building muscle and losing fat at the same time, technically, it’s not possible.

At this point, it becomes increasingly more difficult to lose fat or gain muscle, and both at the same time is pretty much out of the question.\n\nNow, some people – due to their supremely gifted genetics – may be able to continue to build muscle and lose fat at the same time well beyond the beginning phase.

However, even if you’re a mental giant and can push yourself to the absolute limit during your strength training and HIIT sessions, the results will be far from optimal if the dieting component is off the mark. It doesn’t make sense to put in all that hard work and sweat in the gym only to throw it all away by being lackadaisical with what you eat or giving yourself too much leeway. If you want to lose fat and keep it off, you have to be sure the following dieting strategies are in place.\n<h3>Dieting Strategy # 1: Count Your Calories</h3>\nEven if you eat the most organic, nutritious, and most wholesome foods, if the total calories exceed the amount your body is able to burn, then you’re going to gain weight. While other factors play a role, it’s ultimately all about calories in and calories out. This means you have to count the amount of calories in every meal and snack.\n\nWhen you’re in a fat loss phase, you need to gradually decrease your total food intake. A general rule to follow is to lower calories by 500. Maintain the new caloric intake and measure your waistline every week using a fat caliper. As long as you’re losing fat, then maintain the current intake. If fat levels remain the same, then lower intake by another 300-500 calories. Before you do this, though, evaluate other parts of your total regimen and ask yourself the following:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Are you pushing yourself to the max during your HIIT training?</li>\n\t<li>Are you sneaking in a chocolate chip cookie every now and then?</li>\n\t<li>Are you getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep?</li>\n\t<li>Did you skip any training sessions this week?</li>\n</ul>\nIf you can honestly say to yourself that you are doing everything correctly, then it’s time to lower calories.\n\nTo help you keep track of calories, write everything down in a food journal (more on this later).\n\nOn the subject of counting calories, you shouldn’t be eating the same amount day in and out. If you were to eat, say, 2,000 calories every single day, then your body will adjust accordingly by lowering metabolism. Keep your body guessing by eating more on some days and less on others. Here is a sample weekly eating plan where this is outlined:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Monday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">HIIT</td>\n<td width=\"213\">2,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Tuesday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Strength training</td>\n<td width=\"213\">2,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Wednesday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Rest</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Thursday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">HIIT</td>\n<td width=\"213\">2,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Friday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Strength training, HIIT</td>\n<td width=\"213\">2,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Saturday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">HIIT</td>\n<td width=\"213\">2,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Sunday (cheat day)</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Rest</td>\n<td width=\"213\">3,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThe higher calorie days should be saved for your strength training and cheat days, while lower calories should be consumed on days where you rest or only do HIIT.\n<h3>Dieting Strategy #2: Watch Your Macronutrient Ratios</h3>\nSome people claim that as long as you count calories, then ratios don’t matter, meaning you can still lose weight with a ratio like 90% carbs, 5% protein, and 5% fat. Unfortunately, ratios do matter. As you probably are aware of, most trainers advocate for lots of protein in a diet. This is necessary for several reasons.\n\nFirst, protein is made up of important amino acids the muscles need for repairing and replacing damaged muscle tissue caused by strenuous training. After all, next to water, muscle fiber is made up mostly of protein.\n\nSecondly, protein also requires more calorie expenditure for the body to break down and digest. This means more calories burned in the long run.\n\nFinally, protein is mostly consumed in order to keep the carb count down. Here’s the thing about carbs: they’re not necessarily the bad guys that everyone makes them out to be. They are a vital energy component that fuels the body. However, carbs, and especially refined carbs like white rice and white bread, are broken down quickly and rapidly absorbed by the body. This is a good thing if you need the energy right away for a rigorous exercise you are about to do or have just completed. However, during any other time, and when consumed in excess, extra carbs that the body doesn’t need at the moment is stored in the fat cells. <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2005/03/05/obesity-carbs.aspx\">Studies</a> have consistently linked a high body mass index to high intake of simple carbohydrates.\n\nWhen you’re in fat loss phase, keep carbs to a minimum, preferably about 20% to 25%, and most of that should be from complex sources. The only exception to this rule is if you’re consuming whole fruit or if you’re consuming simple carbs as part of your pre or post-workout meal.\n<h3>Dieting Strategy #3: Skip Breakfast Every Now and Then</h3>\nThe saying that breakfast is the most important meal of the day has been thrown around in health circles for ages. For the most part, it has gone unchallenged. However, it’s time to seriously reexamine the merits of a meal after getting out of bed.\n\nBy skipping breakfast and not eating until lunch, you’re going for a longer period than usual without food. Conventional wisdom will lead you to believe that this is a bad thing. A prolonged period without eating is often believed to cause muscle loss and even fat gain due to metabolism slowing down as a response. None of this is true; in fact, quite the opposite.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2405717\">Studies</a> have shown that fasting actually boosts metabolism. On top of that, a separate <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC329619/\">study</a> also showed that it elevates human growth hormones. If done to the extreme by going for consecutive days without eating, then that is when the process becomes counterproductive.\n\nThis isn’t to say that you shouldn’t ever eat breakfast again. By all means, have your morning toast and scrambled eggs. It would certainly help, though, to skip breakfast every now and then, perhaps two days out of the week, or maybe three.\n<h3>Dieting Strategy#4: Be Selective About What You Put in Your Mouth</h3>\nThis is somewhat similar to what was mentioned in dieting strategy #2 about macronutrient ratios. Aside from protein, carbs, and fat, you also have to be selective about where those sources come from because they’re not all created equal.\n\nWhen it comes to protein, for instance, a can of tuna is not equal to a can of Vienna Sausage. Sure, they’re both high in protein, but the latter is made from highly processed mechanically separated meat. On top of that, it’s also sky-high in sodium. Tuna, on the other hand, contains just that, plain tuna fish and water.\n\nSimilar comparisons can be made elsewhere. An orange is not the same as store-bought orange juice. The latter contains zero dietary fiber and contains vitamin C in the form of artificial ascorbic acid, which does not contain the entire molecular structure of actual vitamin C.\n\nThe same applies in many other areas of food selection. A slice of white bread or croissant is not equal to a slice of whole wheat bread even though they may have a similar carb count. A whole peach is not the same as canned peaches. A chicken breast is not the same as a piece of chicken breast found in a prepackaged frozen meal. Always stick to the natural variety as much as possible.\n\nSo what does this have to do with fat loss? More studies are being done on the effects of preservatives on health. It was found in one <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/49949-food-additives-cause-inflammation.html\">study</a> that mice fed preservatives commonly found in prepackaged foods not only gained more weight but experienced more inflammation. Another <a href=\"http://bottomlinehealth.com/how-food-preservatives-make-you-fat/\">study</a> also showed that a common preservative is linked to the thinning of the mucous membrane, which allows bad bacteria to travel beyond the intestines. One of the consequences was increased weight gain.\n<h3>Dieting Strategy: #5: Keep a Food Log</h3>\nIt’s not enough to just keep track of what you’re eating in your head. You need to keep track of everything you eat at every meal. Even if you just add a handful of croutons to your salad, you need to log that in as well. Yes, it seems to be going a bit overboard, but real bodily changes call for doing things that ordinary folks wouldn’t take the extra time to do.\n\nThere are apps that enable you to quickly record what you ate into a database. You can also stick to the old fashion route and log things down via pen and journal. It doesn’t matter how you approach it as long as you keep record.\n\nThe reason a food journal is important is so that you can refer back to it if you hit a plateau. If fat loss came to a halt for a particular week, then you can review your entire dietary pattern for that week. You will know, for instance, whether you went slightly over the calorie limit on a given day or if you allowed yourself to indulge a bit more than you should have on your cheat day.\n\nWith a food journal, you need to be very detailed. With every meal, write down the exact foods you ate, the number of calories it contained, and macronutrient breakdown. You should be so organized that you can refer back to your log and know exactly what you had for breakfast exactly 30 days ago.\n\nA <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080708080738.htm\">study</a> showed that those who kept a food diary loss twice the amount of weight compared to those who don’t write down what they eat or only keep track in their head.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDwxG18GvpI\n<h3>Dieting Strategy #6: Stay Hydrated</h3>\nPeople often don’t factor in their water intake with their diet because H2O contains zero calories. Water, though, plays a major factor in your fat loss endeavors. Not only do you need to count calories, but you need to be counting the cups of water you’re drinking every day, and this should also be logged in your journal.\n\nSo why is water so important with respects to weight loss? For one, dehydration can sometimes be mistaken for hunger, thus causing you to eat more when it’s actually water you should be consuming. Dehydration also slows metabolism and inhibits your body to burn fuel for fat. Water is needed for the liver to function. Part of the organ’s role is to break down and metabolize fat. However, if it’s water-deprived, it will refocus its efforts on water conservation instead of fat burning.\n\nIf you’re physically active, then drink at least one gallon of water a day. This means pure H2O and not coffee, ice tea, or adding a sweetened drink mix into your glass. Drink often during meals and between meals. Some people have concerns about the former, believing that too much water during meal time dilutes the body’s stomach acids, thus slowing digestion. Many nutritionists say that this is not the case, and water with meals actually aid in the digestion process.\n<h3>Dieting Strategy #7: Thoroughly Chew Your Food</h3>\nYes, the length of time you chew your food can actually aid in the weight loss process. It’s one of those small changes that can make a big difference. Aside from helping you lose weight, it also has a range of other health benefits.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/health/body-odd/40-chews-bite-may-be-key-weight-loss-f1C6437172\">Research</a> shows that subjects who chewed their foods for longer periods felt full more quickly and were therefore likely to eat less. The same research also showed that obese subjects were less likely to chew their food thoroughly before swallowing.\n\nThe study recommends chewing the food at least 40 times before swallowing it. This is not necessary; just chew until the food feels mostly mashed up.\n\nThere are other health perks associated with chewing your food thoroughly. This includes improved digestion since the digestive tract has to work less to break the food down. It also improves the body’s ability to absorb the food’s nutrients. Furthermore, improperly broken down foods that enter your intestines may putrefy, thus causing feelings of gas and bloating.\n\nWith a busy schedule, eating tends to take a back seat, and people may quickly wolf down their lunch as a means of saving time. However, it’s beneficial to just take the time to really enjoy your meal and savor every bite. Enjoy the taste in your mouth as you chew and give it extra time for the saliva to form in your mouth and really break the food down.\n<h3>Dieting Strategy #8: Eat Foods That Promote Weight Loss</h3>\nCertain foods have thermogenic properties. Others make you full despite eating only a small portion. Make these foods a part of your regular diet for a fat loss boost:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Lentils – It’s rich in iron. Iron deficiency is linked to lower metabolism.</li>\n\t<li>Hot peppers – capsaicin, which gives peppers its hot flavor, also heats up the body when ingested, thus elevating thermogenesis.</li>\n\t<li>Eggs – They’re a rich source of vitamin B12, which is essential for metabolizing fat.</li>\n\t<li>Beets – This root vegetable is rich in nitrates, which widen blood vessels and improves blood flow. This leads to increased performance in the gym, which translates to more calories burned.</li>\n\t<li>Citrus foods – The high acidity in fruits like lemons and oranges slows down digestion, thus keeping you full longer.</li>\n\t<li>Cinnamon – This spice has been known to make fat cells more responsive to insulin and upping your metabolism.</li>\n\t<li>Ginger – Ginger root is rich in acids known to stimulate gastric enzymes that help raise metabolism.</li>\n</ul>\nOn the subject of foods for fat loss, also consider adding a fat burning supplement to your diet. While a supplement like <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/tea-rexx/\">Tea Rexx</a> doesn’t exactly constitute as food, it does contain powerful ingredients like green tea extract that has been shown to provide antioxidant support and boost metabolism.\n<h3>Dieting Strategy #9: Allow Yourself a Cheat Day</h3>\nYes, a cheat day is a good thing and for more than one reason. The obvious is its ability to keep the cravings at bay. A cheat day is basically your once-a-week reward for the other six days of eating clean and working out rigorously in the gym. This will lessen the temptation to sway from your diet.\n\nA cheat day is also beneficial as the occasional higher caloric intake prevents your body from getting too accustomed to a constant calorie deficit. Remember, the body is very good at adapting to just about any condition you present to it. If you maintain a low calorie diet for a prolonged period, then it will eventually adapt by lowering metabolism. Low calorie diets are also known to lower the body’s production of leptin. This hormone is invaluable as it relays messages to your brain telling it to burn fatty tissue for energy.\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind, though, that a cheat day isn’t a license to freely splurge at your heart’s delight. It doesn’t mean you should eat an entire chocolate cake or five bacon cheeseburgers in a single sitting. You still have to exercise some discipline. You still need to count calories. As a general rule, you should consume no more than 50% above your normal daily intake. Certain foods should also be kept to a minimum. This includes anything high in trans-fats. This includes fried foods, certain pastries like pies, and flaky biscuits. You can eat them; just limit them to a single serving.\n<h3>Never Underestimate the Importance of Your Diet</h3>\nFood is very complex and can be extremely beneficial or extremely damaging to your fat loss goals depending on how you approach it. Everything from food quality, food quantity, and food timing all matter, and they all have to be in place for maximum fat loss to take into effect.\n\nOn a final note, don’t forget the importance of supplementation. A product like <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/tea-rexx/\">Tea Rexx</a> won’t do much by itself, but when all the other dieting components are in place, it will provide that extra edge to burn that final inch of stubborn flab.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>You can train like a man or women possessed. However, even if you’re a mental giant and can push yourself to the absolute limit during your strength training and HIIT sessions, the results will be far from optimal if the dieting component is off the mark. It doesn’t make sense to put in all that hard work and sweat in the gym only to throw it all away by being lackadaisical with what you eat or giving yourself too much leeway. If you want to lose fat and keep it off, you have to be sure the following dieting strategies are in place.  </p>\n\n<h3>Dieting Strategy # 1: Count Your Calories</h3>  \n\n<p>Even if you eat the most organic, nutritious, and most wholesome foods, if the total calories exceed the amount your body is able to burn, then you’re going to gain weight. While other factors play a role, it’s ultimately all about calories in and calories out. This means you have to count the amount of calories in every meal and snack.</p>\n\n<p>When you’re in a fat loss phase, you need to gradually decrease your total food intake. A general rule to follow is to lower calories by 500. Maintain the new caloric intake and measure your waistline every week using a fat caliper. As long as you’re losing fat, then maintain the current intake. If fat levels remain the same, then lower intake by another 300-500 calories. Before you do this, though, evaluate other parts of your total regimen and ask yourself the following:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n    <li>Are you pushing yourself to the max during your HIIT training?</li>\n    <li>Are you sneaking in a chocolate chip cookie every now and then?</li>\n    <li>Are you getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep?</li>\n    <li>Did you skip any training sessions this week?</li>\n</ul>  \n\n<p>If you can honestly say to yourself that you are doing everything correctly, then it’s time to lower calories.</p>\n\n<p>To help you keep track of calories, write everything down in a food journal (more on this later).</p>\n\n<p>On the subject of counting calories, you shouldn’t be eating the same amount day in and out. If you were to eat, say, 2,000 calories every single day, then your body will adjust accordingly by lowering metabolism. Keep your body guessing by eating more on some days and less on others. Here is a sample weekly eating plan where this is outlined:  </p>\n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\">Monday</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">HIIT</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">2,000 calories</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\">Tuesday</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">Strength training</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">2,500 calories</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\">Wednesday</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">Rest</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">1,500 calories</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\">Thursday</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">HIIT</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">2,000 calories</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\">Friday</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">Strength training, HIIT</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">2,500 calories</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\">Saturday</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">HIIT</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">2,000 calories</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\">Sunday (cheat day)</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">Rest</td>  \n<td width=\"213\">3,000 calories</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<p>The higher calorie days should be saved for your strength training and cheat days, while lower calories should be consumed on days where you rest or only do HIIT.  </p>\n\n<h3>Dieting Strategy #2: Watch Your Macronutrient Ratios</h3>  \n\n<p>Some people claim that as long as you count calories, then ratios don’t matter, meaning you can still lose weight with a ratio like 90% carbs, 5% protein, and 5% fat. Unfortunately, ratios do matter. As you probably are aware of, most trainers advocate for lots of protein in a diet. This is necessary for several reasons.</p>\n\n<p>First, protein is made up of important amino acids the muscles need for repairing and replacing damaged muscle tissue caused by strenuous training. After all, next to water, muscle fiber is made up mostly of protein.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, protein also requires more calorie expenditure for the body to break down and digest. This means more calories burned in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, protein is mostly consumed in order to keep the carb count down. Here’s the thing about carbs: they’re not necessarily the bad guys that everyone makes them out to be. They are a vital energy component that fuels the body. However, carbs, and especially refined carbs like white rice and white bread, are broken down quickly and rapidly absorbed by the body. This is a good thing if you need the energy right away for a rigorous exercise you are about to do or have just completed. However, during any other time, and when consumed in excess, extra carbs that the body doesn’t need at the moment is stored in the fat cells. <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2005/03/05/obesity-carbs.aspx\">Studies</a> have consistently linked a high body mass index to high intake of simple carbohydrates.</p>\n\n<p>When you’re in fat loss phase, keep carbs to a minimum, preferably about 20% to 25%, and most of that should be from complex sources. The only exception to this rule is if you’re consuming whole fruit or if you’re consuming simple carbs as part of your pre or post-workout meal.  </p>\n\n<h3>Dieting Strategy #3: Skip Breakfast Every Now and Then</h3>  \n\n<p>The saying that breakfast is the most important meal of the day has been thrown around in health circles for ages. For the most part, it has gone unchallenged. However, it’s time to seriously reexamine the merits of a meal after getting out of bed.</p>\n\n<p>By skipping breakfast and not eating until lunch, you’re going for a longer period than usual without food. Conventional wisdom will lead you to believe that this is a bad thing. A prolonged period without eating is often believed to cause muscle loss and even fat gain due to metabolism slowing down as a response. None of this is true; in fact, quite the opposite.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2405717\">Studies</a> have shown that fasting actually boosts metabolism. On top of that, a separate <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC329619/\">study</a> also showed that it elevates human growth hormones. If done to the extreme by going for consecutive days without eating, then that is when the process becomes counterproductive.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t ever eat breakfast again. By all means, have your morning toast and scrambled eggs. It would certainly help, though, to skip breakfast every now and then, perhaps two days out of the week, or maybe three.  </p>\n\n<h3>Dieting Strategy#4: Be Selective About What You Put in Your Mouth</h3>  \n\n<p>This is somewhat similar to what was mentioned in dieting strategy #2 about macronutrient ratios. Aside from protein, carbs, and fat, you also have to be selective about where those sources come from because they’re not all created equal.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to protein, for instance, a can of tuna is not equal to a can of Vienna Sausage. Sure, they’re both high in protein, but the latter is made from highly processed mechanically separated meat. On top of that, it’s also sky-high in sodium. Tuna, on the other hand, contains just that, plain tuna fish and water.</p>\n\n<p>Similar comparisons can be made elsewhere. An orange is not the same as store-bought orange juice. The latter contains zero dietary fiber and contains vitamin C in the form of artificial ascorbic acid, which does not contain the entire molecular structure of actual vitamin C.</p>\n\n<p>The same applies in many other areas of food selection. A slice of white bread or croissant is not equal to a slice of whole wheat bread even though they may have a similar carb count. A whole peach is not the same as canned peaches. A chicken breast is not the same as a piece of chicken breast found in a prepackaged frozen meal. Always stick to the natural variety as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>So what does this have to do with fat loss? More studies are being done on the effects of preservatives on health. It was found in one <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/49949-food-additives-cause-inflammation.html\">study</a> that mice fed preservatives commonly found in prepackaged foods not only gained more weight but experienced more inflammation. Another <a href=\"http://bottomlinehealth.com/how-food-preservatives-make-you-fat/\">study</a> also showed that a common preservative is linked to the thinning of the mucous membrane, which allows bad bacteria to travel beyond the intestines. One of the consequences was increased weight gain.  </p>\n\n<h3>Dieting Strategy: #5: Keep a Food Log</h3>  \n\n<p>It’s not enough to just keep track of what you’re eating in your head. You need to keep track of everything you eat at every meal. Even if you just add a handful of croutons to your salad, you need to log that in as well. Yes, it seems to be going a bit overboard, but real bodily changes call for doing things that ordinary folks wouldn’t take the extra time to do.</p>\n\n<p>There are apps that enable you to quickly record what you ate into a database. You can also stick to the old fashion route and log things down via pen and journal. It doesn’t matter how you approach it as long as you keep record.</p>\n\n<p>The reason a food journal is important is so that you can refer back to it if you hit a plateau. If fat loss came to a halt for a particular week, then you can review your entire dietary pattern for that week. You will know, for instance, whether you went slightly over the calorie limit on a given day or if you allowed yourself to indulge a bit more than you should have on your cheat day.</p>\n\n<p>With a food journal, you need to be very detailed. With every meal, write down the exact foods you ate, the number of calories it contained, and macronutrient breakdown. You should be so organized that you can refer back to your log and know exactly what you had for breakfast exactly 30 days ago.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080708080738.htm\">study</a> showed that those who kept a food diary loss twice the amount of weight compared to those who don’t write down what they eat or only keep track in their head.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDwxG18GvpI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDwxG18GvpI</a>  </p>\n\n<h3>Dieting Strategy #6: Stay Hydrated</h3>  \n\n<p>People often don’t factor in their water intake with their diet because H2O contains zero calories. Water, though, plays a major factor in your fat loss endeavors. Not only do you need to count calories, but you need to be counting the cups of water you’re drinking every day, and this should also be logged in your journal.</p>\n\n<p>So why is water so important with respects to weight loss? For one, dehydration can sometimes be mistaken for hunger, thus causing you to eat more when it’s actually water you should be consuming. Dehydration also slows metabolism and inhibits your body to burn fuel for fat. Water is needed for the liver to function. Part of the organ’s role is to break down and metabolize fat. However, if it’s water-deprived, it will refocus its efforts on water conservation instead of fat burning.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re physically active, then drink at least one gallon of water a day. This means pure H2O and not coffee, ice tea, or adding a sweetened drink mix into your glass. Drink often during meals and between meals. Some people have concerns about the former, believing that too much water during meal time dilutes the body’s stomach acids, thus slowing digestion. Many nutritionists say that this is not the case, and water with meals actually aid in the digestion process.  </p>\n\n<h3>Dieting Strategy #7: Thoroughly Chew Your Food</h3>  \n\n<p>Yes, the length of time you chew your food can actually aid in the weight loss process. It’s one of those small changes that can make a big difference. Aside from helping you lose weight, it also has a range of other health benefits.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/health/body-odd/40-chews-bite-may-be-key-weight-loss-f1C6437172\">Research</a> shows that subjects who chewed their foods for longer periods felt full more quickly and were therefore likely to eat less. The same research also showed that obese subjects were less likely to chew their food thoroughly before swallowing.</p>\n\n<p>The study recommends chewing the food at least 40 times before swallowing it. This is not necessary; just chew until the food feels mostly mashed up.</p>\n\n<p>There are other health perks associated with chewing your food thoroughly. This includes improved digestion since the digestive tract has to work less to break the food down. It also improves the body’s ability to absorb the food’s nutrients. Furthermore, improperly broken down foods that enter your intestines may putrefy, thus causing feelings of gas and bloating.</p>\n\n<p>With a busy schedule, eating tends to take a back seat, and people may quickly wolf down their lunch as a means of saving time. However, it’s beneficial to just take the time to really enjoy your meal and savor every bite. Enjoy the taste in your mouth as you chew and give it extra time for the saliva to form in your mouth and really break the food down.  </p>\n\n<h3>Dieting Strategy #8: Eat Foods That Promote Weight Loss</h3>  \n\n<p>Certain foods have thermogenic properties. Others make you full despite eating only a small portion. Make these foods a part of your regular diet for a fat loss boost:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n    <li>Lentils – It’s rich in iron. Iron deficiency is linked to lower metabolism.</li>\n    <li>Hot peppers – capsaicin, which gives peppers its hot flavor, also heats up the body when ingested, thus elevating thermogenesis.</li>\n    <li>Eggs – They’re a rich source of vitamin B12, which is essential for metabolizing fat.</li>\n    <li>Beets – This root vegetable is rich in nitrates, which widen blood vessels and improves blood flow. This leads to increased performance in the gym, which translates to more calories burned.</li>\n    <li>Citrus foods – The high acidity in fruits like lemons and oranges slows down digestion, thus keeping you full longer.</li>\n    <li>Cinnamon – This spice has been known to make fat cells more responsive to insulin and upping your metabolism.</li>\n    <li>Ginger – Ginger root is rich in acids known to stimulate gastric enzymes that help raise metabolism.</li>\n</ul>  \n\n<p>On the subject of foods for fat loss, also consider adding a fat burning supplement to your diet. While a supplement like <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/tea-rexx/\">Tea Rexx</a> doesn’t exactly constitute as food, it does contain powerful ingredients like green tea extract that has been shown to provide antioxidant support and boost metabolism.  </p>\n\n<h3>Dieting Strategy #9: Allow Yourself a Cheat Day</h3>  \n\n<p>Yes, a cheat day is a good thing and for more than one reason. The obvious is its ability to keep the cravings at bay. A cheat day is basically your once-a-week reward for the other six days of eating clean and working out rigorously in the gym. This will lessen the temptation to sway from your diet.</p>\n\n<p>A cheat day is also beneficial as the occasional higher caloric intake prevents your body from getting too accustomed to a constant calorie deficit. Remember, the body is very good at adapting to just about any condition you present to it. If you maintain a low calorie diet for a prolonged period, then it will eventually adapt by lowering metabolism. Low calorie diets are also known to lower the body’s production of leptin. This hormone is invaluable as it relays messages to your brain telling it to burn fatty tissue for energy.</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to keep in mind, though, that a cheat day isn’t a license to freely splurge at your heart’s delight.

As a general rule, you should consume no more than 50% above your normal daily intake. Certain foods should also be kept to a minimum. This includes anything high in trans-fats. This includes fried foods, certain pastries like pies, and flaky biscuits. You can eat them; just limit them to a single serving.  </p>\n\n<h3>Never Underestimate the Importance of Your Diet</h3>  \n\n<p>Food is very complex and can be extremely beneficial or extremely damaging to your fat loss goals depending on how you approach it.

That is certainly a large part of it, but there are a lot of other in-betweens involved. The more you know about fat loss, the better you can set goals that are realistic and achievable within a reasonable timeframe. Approaching a fat loss plan with a bunch of half-truths can set you astray and lead to frustration, thus making you quit well before you reached your potential.\n<h3>What You Need to Know About a Calorie Deficit</h3>\nTheoretically, you can lose weight eating nothing but cheeseburgers and Twinkies provided that the total caloric intake is below what your body burns. In fact, there are success stories of people losing weight eating nothing but McDonalds. It’s true; here’s one such <a href=\"http://www.today.com/health/man-loses-56-pounds-after-eating-only-mcdonalds-six-months-2D79329158\">story</a> of an educator losing 56 pounds after six months of subsiding primarily on McDs.\n\nYes, this can work for you as well, but please bear in mind that you also need to keep a health component in mind when following a fat loss plan. Fast food is laden with empty calories, grease, and trans-fat. Sure, you may lose weight but at the expense of your long-term health.\n\nYour diet needs to be nutrient-dense and consist of natural foods with limited preservatives. Not all calories are created equal, so don’t think that you can lose weight in a healthy manner with chocolate cake as a mainstay of your diet. This isn’t to say you can never occasionally have a slice of cake or dine at greasy spoons; just limit them to your cheat day.\n\nMacronutrients matter as well. When on a fat loss phase, protein intake should make up a good 70% to 80% of your total caloric intake. If you’re familiar with the food pyramid, then the breads and whole grain section (at the bottom of the pyramid) is basically trading spots with the meat and poultry section, located somewhere in the mid-tier.\n<h3>Toss Out the Scale</h3>\nOkay, you don’t necessarily have to forgo the bathroom scale; by all means, use it. However, it should be used in conjunction with a fat caliper or a tape measure to gauge your body fat levels. The conventional bathroom scale is crap for measuring progress. Here’s why the scale is unreliable:\n<ul>\n\t<li>It measures total body weight. You can weigh the same by losing body fat while gaining muscle. Yet, the scale doesn’t tell you that.</li>\n\t<li>You may weigh a bit more on a given day due to additional water retention (possibly from consuming too much sodium).</li>\n\t<li>You may weigh a bit more due to extra bodily excrement (resolvable by answering nature’s call)</li>\n</ul>\nThis is why losing weight and losing fat are two different things despite often being used interchangeably. Also, if you decide to continue to use the scale, then always weigh yourself at the same time of day, preferably first thing in the morning. This will prevent factors like a recently consumed lunch from influencing the numbers.\n<h3>Fat Loss Is Hardly a Linear Process</h3>\nFat loss is almost never a consistent process. In other words, if you lost 2 pounds of fat one week, it doesn’t mean you will lose another 2 pounds the next week even if you follow exactly the same process. Usually, you’ll see some initial success before the results begin tapering down and you hit a plateau. This is because the more body fat you lose, the harder it becomes to lose the final remaining pounds. This is a survival mechanism; six-pack abs, after all, is really not natural if you think about it. The body is meant to carry some body fat. Your body will make every effort to adjust by lowering metabolism, hence the importance of never sticking to the same diet or exercise for too long.\n\nDon’t get discouraged if in a particular week you don’t see any gains. In fact, it’s guaranteed to happen and likely more than once. Fat loss is a roller coaster process; in one week, you may lose 3 pounds, the next week you may only lose 1, the week after that you may lose nothing. This could be followed by a week where you lose another 1 or 2 pounds.\n\nWhile your fat loss journey may not be a linear process, you can tip the scales in your favor by consistently changing things up in both your diet and workouts. Alternate the number of calories you consume from day-to-day. Likewise, experiment with different exercises in your HIIT workout.\n<h3>Everyone Loses Fat at a Different Rate</h3>\nIt’s true that some people are blessed with god-given genetics and can consistently burn fat despite putting in very little effort. Let’s just get it out there that you’re probably not one of those fortunate few. As such, you and a friend could follow the exact same workout and dieting program and experience entirely different results. Your friend could very well see a higher degree of success despite putting in the same effort. This can be discouraging, but it’s simply genetics that are at play. There’s no point in wallowing in something that you have no control over. Just worry about your own progress and switch up the regimen from what your friend is doing if need be.\n<h3>Slaying the Myth of Spot Reduction</h3>\nThis is one of those myths that just won’t die despite being debunked in countless studies. People just want to wholeheartedly believe that it’s true because they have those troubled spots that they just wish would go away. It’s just plain reality that you can’t trim your waistline by focusing super hard on sit-ups.\n\nFocus on fat loss as a whole rather than exclusively targeting a single troubled spot. This means focusing on your diet and HIIT cardio and trusting that the fat from all areas will eventually melt off.\n\nOne more thing regarding spot reduction: while it isn’t doable, some people do lose more fat in one area than they do in another. For this reason, it’s very possible to acquire chiseled abs yet still have a bit of flab and cellulite in the thighs and upper arms, or vice versa. It all comes down to genetics, so don’t fret if your fat loss results aren’t completely proportional.\n<h3>The Truth About Fat and Carbs</h3>\nFor years, the fitness industry railed against the implications of a high-fat diet. Later, carbs became the new dietary enemy that everyone was advised to avoid like the plague. Is there any grain of truth to either of these?\n\nHere’s the deal about fat: eating it does not make you fat, or not directly at least. Remember, it’s all about calories in vs calories out, so it’s eating too many calories – regardless of whether it’s from fat, carbs, or protein – that makes you fat. However, fat does contain more calories than the other two macronutrients. Each gram of fat contains 9 calories, compared to only 4 calories for carbs and protein. Therefore, those who consume a high-fat diet also tend to consume more calories, and hence gain more weight in the process.\n\nWhat about carbs? Well, that’s an entirely different story. Refined carbs, such as that from table sugar or white bread, are quickly digested, and if you consume more than your body needs, then any leftovers the body doesn’t need at the moment will be stored away as body fat. It goes without saying that – with the exception of whole fruit – you should stick to complex carb sources, such as oatmeal, sweet potatoes, and whole grains.\n<h3>Forget About the Fat Burning Zone</h3>\nIn aerobic circles, the term “fat burning zone” is treated like a sacred scripture in the Bible. It basically states that in order to maximize fat loss, you have to train at 50% to 60% of your max heart rate. This is equivalent to the intensity that you would perform when doing traditional steady-state cardio, such as a 30-minute jog that a lot of people seem to insist on sticking to.\n\nHere’s the thing about the fat burning zone: it’s a myth and has been debunked in numerous studies, such as in this <a href=\"http://www.alanaragon.com/myths-under-the-microscope-the-fat-burning-zone-fasted-cardio.html\">one</a>.\n\nHere is why the fat burning zone is complete poppycock. When you perform cardio, your body expends fuel from two sources: glycogen (from consumed carbohydrates) and fat stores. Just about any type of cardio, from brisk walking to sprinting, burns calories from glycogen as well as fat stores. It’s true that when you train in the fat burning zone that you burn a greater ratio of energy from fat than from glycogen. This is why there is so much advocacy for training in this zone.\n\nYou have to remember, though, that it’s all, or rather mostly, about calories in vs calories out. Cardio done at a higher pace burns more calories overall. Even more importantly, HIIT-style training has an after-burn effect. More formerly known as “excess post-exercise oxygen consumption” (EPOC), the after-burn effects refers to the elevation of metabolism from baseline levels after the workout ends.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIupxbukUgY\n\nWhile <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17101527\">studies</a> differ, some show that the after-burn effect continues for up to 72 hours before metabolism returns to baseline levels. This means one 20-minute HIIT session will have you burning calories for as long three days and all from a single workout. The after-burn effect simply does not take place or only marginally so when training in the fat burning zone.\n\nYes, it’s true that training in the fat burning zone burns a slightly greater ratio of energy from fat. However, the increase is negligible in the bigger scheme of things. Even then, you can easily do HIIT and get the body to burn more calories from fat by training in a fasted state when the body is depleted of glycogen.\n<h3>Supplementation Plays a Secondary but Important Role</h3>\nSupplements are perhaps one of the most controversial topics in the fitness industry. This is especially so when it comes to fat loss supplements. While they’re certainly helpful, you have to have a realistic outlook on what supplements can and cannot do. Some people look to them as the instant solution to their plateaus, while others think of supplements as a byproduct of a greedy multi-million dollar industry and refuse to touch them with a 10-feet pole.\n\nIt’s best to be a healthy skeptic when it comes to supplements. Fat burners can especially be tricky because there are so many varieties and proprietary blends out there. Indeed, there are many that are useless and made from unproven ingredients. However, there are also those that use blends consisting of long proven compounds for raising thermogenesis and/or suppressing appetite. <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/tea-rexx/\">Tea Rexx</a> is one fat burner that doesn’t rely on gimmicky proprietary blends or the latest “breakthrough” ingredients.\n\nIf you do decide to use a fat burner, just remember that it’s a secondary aid and that your workouts and diet come first. Too many people get lax on their training and dietary regimen believing that a newly acquired supplement makes it okay to do so.\n<h3>Fat Loss Becomes More Difficult With Age</h3>\nWrinkles aren’t the only unfortunate consequence of father time. As you age, hormonal changes also take place. Your metabolism also naturally begins to slow. Some estimates suggest a metabolic decline of 5% every 10 years starting from age 40. For men, natural testosterone production also begins to wane, thus making it harder to put on muscle mass. Less lean mass also translates to a lower metabolism.\n\nLifestyle factors are also involved as well. In your 30s and 40s, you are likely to face more stress and sleep less due to work and family obligations that you didn’t have to deal with in your 20s. Stress and lack of sleep creates hormonal imbalance and leaves you vulnerable to increased cortisol levels, not to mention the hazardous effects of cell damage from free radicals.\n\nWhile you may have to work just a bit harder than someone 10-20 years your junior, it’s still very much possible to lose fat and keep it off. It becomes even more important to follow a strict regimen of dieting, HIIT cardio, and strength training. While a younger person following the same regimen may be able to afford being a little more lackadaisical with their approach, you have no such luxury. If you happen to be a 20-something year old reading this, then enjoy your youth while it lasts because chiseled abs won’t be as easy to maintain or acquire 10 years from now.\n<h3>Have Realistic Expectations</h3>\nThere are so many variables that come into play when it comes to fat loss. This is why results are not always predictable. However, you can increase the odds in your favor by following a workout and dieting plan that is rooted in science. The same goes for supplementation. Taking a fat burner like <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/tea-rexx/\">Tea Rexx</a> helps you reach your goal a bit faster provided that the far more important exercising and eating components are in place.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>On the surface, fat loss seems like a simple process: you lose fat by burning more calories than your body takes in. That is certainly a large part of it, but there are a lot of other in-betweens involved. The more you know about fat loss, the better you can set goals that are realistic and achievable within a reasonable timeframe. Approaching a fat loss plan with a bunch of half-truths can set you astray and lead to frustration, thus making you quit well before you reached your potential.  </p>\n\n<h3>What You Need to Know About a Calorie Deficit</h3>  \n\n<p>Theoretically, you can lose weight eating nothing but cheeseburgers and Twinkies provided that the total caloric intake is below what your body burns. In fact, there are success stories of people losing weight eating nothing but McDonalds. It’s true; here’s one such <a href=\"http://www.today.com/health/man-loses-56-pounds-after-eating-only-mcdonalds-six-months-2D79329158\">story</a> of an educator losing 56 pounds after six months of subsiding primarily on McDs.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, this can work for you as well, but please bear in mind that you also need to keep a health component in mind when following a fat loss plan. Fast food is laden with empty calories, grease, and trans-fat. Sure, you may lose weight but at the expense of your long-term health.</p>\n\n<p>Your diet needs to be nutrient-dense and consist of natural foods with limited preservatives. Not all calories are created equal, so don’t think that you can lose weight in a healthy manner with chocolate cake as a mainstay of your diet. This isn’t to say you can never occasionally have a slice of cake or dine at greasy spoons; just limit them to your cheat day.</p>\n\n<p>Macronutrients matter as well. When on a fat loss phase, protein intake should make up a good 70% to 80% of your total caloric intake. If you’re familiar with the food pyramid, then the breads and whole grain section (at the bottom of the pyramid) is basically trading spots with the meat and poultry section, located somewhere in the mid-tier.  </p>\n\n<h3>Toss Out the Scale</h3>  \n\n<p>Okay, you don’t necessarily have to forgo the bathroom scale; by all means, use it. However, it should be used in conjunction with a fat caliper or a tape measure to gauge your body fat levels. The conventional bathroom scale is crap for measuring progress. Here’s why the scale is unreliable:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n    <li>It measures total body weight. You can weigh the same by losing body fat while gaining muscle. Yet, the scale doesn’t tell you that.</li>\n    <li>You may weigh a bit more on a given day due to additional water retention (possibly from consuming too much sodium).</li>\n    <li>You may weigh a bit more due to extra bodily excrement (resolvable by answering nature’s call)</li>\n</ul>  \n\n<p>This is why losing weight and losing fat are two different things despite often being used interchangeably.

Apples are also believed to contain antioxidants that protect the body against metabolic syndrome, a condition that greatly elevates one’s risk for developing diabetes and excess weight gain. Very few ingredients are required, so this is a very easy snack to make and only takes about an hour to bake in the oven.\n\n<strong>Ingredients</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>3 apples (any variety)</li>\n\t<li>ground cinnamon</li>\n\t<li>granulated sugar</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2013/07/22/baked-cinnamon-apple-chips/\">Get this Recipe</a>\n<h3>14.

It's your man Big Brandon Carter</strong>\n\nA lot of people ask me:\n\n<em><strong>\"Hey Brandon Carter, I'm so hungry when I'm doing intermittent fasting, how do I stop the hunger?\"</strong></em> And I want to just say <em><strong>\"Ay, yo shut the fuck up!\"</strong></em>\n\nBut, in an effort to be tactful, I give the following advice.\n\nOne, you should know that it is going to take your body a few weeks to acclimate to your new eating schedule. Your body is used to converting food into glycogen or glucose and then using that glucose for energy. So when you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">restrict glucose by fasting your body's like<em><strong> \"Yo what the FUCK?\"</strong></em> It doesn't know what to do and then you get the Hangrys and you start acting crazy.\n\nBut sooner or later you're body is going to understand that it's not going to get anymore glucose in the morning. That takes about a week or two, sometimes even three. Then once your body acclimates to the new circumstances, what it's going to start doing is once it has used up all the glucose during your fast to run, to keep you alive, to keep you moving and your organs pumping and keep your brain working and all that it's going to run off your fat cells.\n\nHumans have evolved to store fat. The purpose of it is to have a<em><strong> surplus</strong></em> of energy during a time of caloric <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">scarcity, so fat is made to be your reserved energy. But your body would rather run on glucose and that's what you're going through, like a glucose/glycogen withdrawal.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02210/evo2_2210436b.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"323\" />\n\nBut once your body starts to tap into your fat reserves, after a few weeks, you'll notice the hunger goes away. I feel <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">great during the fast now. In fact, it's almost a little sad when I break it because genetically my people, we have a syndrome called the <em><strong>\"Itis.\"</strong></em> We eat and then we get tired. So I have more energy during my fast just because I've been fasting for like 3 years now.\n\nBut to help you acclimate to the circumstances with the hunger, one of the best things to do is have <em><strong>coffee.</strong></em>\n\nCoffee is a natural appetite suppressant, as well as caffeine. You would have to drink <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">black coffee, don't put no cream or sugar, don't get fancy, nothing sweet man, hardcore - black coffee. That's going to really help mitigate hunger and give you more energy during the fast while your body's adjusting. Even after the adjustment you'll notice that the caffeine just makes you more alert especially on an empty stomach.\n\nAnd If I were you..\n\nI wouldn't drink just regular ass basic bitch coffee. That basic ass motherfucking coffee that every asshole is drinking.\n\nIf I was you I would drink a coffee that's a little more hardcore. The most hardcore badass coffee... wait, whats the name of it?\n\n*Bella's high pitched feminine voice*\n<strong>FIGHTER FUEL!</strong>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1157/0092/products/3d_2.jpg?v=1457636643\" width=\"407\" height=\"407\" />\n\nThat's right, <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/products/fighter-fuel?variant=14954915207\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fighter Fuel</a>.

The more they roast the coffee, make it darker, the more it dilutes the caffeine levels. So we just warmed up a little bit, keeping it light as hell.\n\nThen we did something extra. We added a special ingredient...\n\nWe put <strong>GINSENG</strong> in it!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://profitsfromnature.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ginseng-seed-FWS.gov_.jpg\" width=\"291\" height=\"278\" />\n\nMore natural <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>energy</strong>, <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">focus</strong>, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>alertness</strong>.\n\nIt's a historical fact that ancient Chinese warriors during the time of the Ming dynasty, and all that other shit, when they were getting poppin, you know, war time. They would get hyped up on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">ginseng before they would go fight. Ginseng has been fueling fighters for centuries.\n\nThat's why we called our coffee<em> FIGHTER</em> Fuel.

I've been a big proponent of cheat day and people just have a bunch of questions like,\n\n<em><strong>\"Should you do it?\" </strong></em>or<em><strong> \"Should it be a cheat day or a cheat meal?\"</strong></em>\n\nFirst of all, if you're dieting it's important if you have a cheat day for two reasons. One is a hormonal reason. If you're in a caloric deficit for too long your body thinks it's<strong> starving</strong> so it slows down your metabolism and shuts down some of your hormone production like testosterone and a really important hormone called<em><strong> \"Leptin\"</strong></em> which is really important for the fat burning process.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\nNow a cheat day once a week is just one day where you have higher calories and you tell your body <em><strong>\"Hey man, we ain't starving, chill the fuck out, pump them hormones back up, and raise the metabolism.\"</strong></em> It doesn't need to conserve that much energy because it's not going through a famine, it's not starving.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.menshealth.com/sites/menshealth.com/files/articles/2016/02/mh-sugar-usa2shutterstock_1262786212.jpg\" width=\"587\" height=\"373\" />\n<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\nAnother reason is psychologically, it's easier for me to stay strict six days a week on my diet if I know at the end of the week I can eat whatever the fuck the I want. It's just one day a week you eat whatever you want. You just don't think about it. It's not a challenge though, you can go overboard. It's <strong>not</strong> a day you cheat death. It's a day you don't think about food at all. You eat like a normal person. Go to brunch with your peoples, do all that shit.\n<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://authoritynutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/man-with-fork-eating-broccoli-facebook.jpg\" width=\"587\" height=\"308\" /></i>\n\n<strong><em>\"If you do intermittent fasting, should you fast on cheat day?\"</em></strong>\n\nYou can. You don't have to. Remember, it's a day you don't think about nutrition so if you want to, cool. If you don't, cool. It doesn't fucking matter. It's as much as a mental day off as it is a physical day off. That way you can hit it harder on Monday <em><strong>(pause)</strong></em> and be strict the other six days. Now, if you're not strict the other six days you don't deserve a cheat day.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\n<strong><em>\"Hey man, will I fuck up my gains on cheat day?\"</em></strong><span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\nWell you will fuck it up if you <strong>TRY</strong> to.

I've been a big proponent of cheat day and people just have a bunch of questions like,</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>\"Should you do it?\" </strong></em>or<em><strong> \"Should it be a cheat day or a cheat meal?\"</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>First of all, if you're dieting it's important if you have a cheat day for two reasons. One is a hormonal reason. If you're in a caloric deficit for too long your body thinks it's<strong> starving</strong> so it slows down your metabolism and shuts down some of your hormone production like testosterone and a really important hormone called<em><strong> \"Leptin\"</strong></em> which is really important for the fat burning process.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\"> <br />\n</i></p>\n\n<p>Now a cheat day once a week is just one day where you have higher calories and you tell your body <em><strong>\"Hey man, we ain't starving, chill the fuck out, pump them hormones back up, and raise the metabolism.\"</strong></em> It doesn't need to conserve that much energy because it's not going through a famine, it's not starving.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.menshealth.com/sites/menshealth.com/files/articles/2016/02/mh-sugar-usa2shutterstock_1262786212.jpg\" width=\"587\" height=\"373\" /> <br />\n<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\"> <br />\n</i></p>\n\n<p>Another reason is psychologically, it's easier for me to stay strict six days a week on my diet if I know at the end of the week I can eat whatever the fuck the I want. It's just one day a week you eat whatever you want. You just don't think about it. It's not a challenge though, you can go overboard. It's <strong>not</strong> a day you cheat death. It's a day you don't think about food at all. You eat like a normal person. Go to brunch with your peoples, do all that shit. <br />\n<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://authoritynutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/man-with-fork-eating-broccoli-facebook.jpg\" width=\"587\" height=\"308\" /></i></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>\"If you do intermittent fasting, should you fast on cheat day?\"</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>You can. You don't have to. Remember, it's a day you don't think about nutrition so if you want to, cool. If you don't, cool. It doesn't fucking matter. It's as much as a mental day off as it is a physical day off. That way you can hit it harder on Monday <em><strong>(pause)</strong></em> and be strict the other six days. Now, if you're not strict the other six days you don't deserve a cheat day.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\"> <br />\n</i></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>\"Hey man, will I fuck up my gains on cheat day?\"</em></strong><span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\"> <br />\n</i></p>\n\n<p>Well you will fuck it up if you <strong>TRY</strong> to.

First I want to say, anyone who's working out for a certain amount of time is going to get some kind of injury. <em><strong>It's inevitable.</strong></em> You're going to get hurt, don't stress out about it, everyone does.\n\nBut, there are a few things you can do to mitigate injury. You can't completely circumvent it, but you can mitigate it if you follow these three simple tips.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.gymlion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Warm-up.jpg\" width=\"458\" height=\"306\" />\n\nOne, make sure you warm up. Before I work out I do just a little bit of cardio, like jumping rope, or the treadmill. Nothing crazy, just enough to break a sweat. But I save my real cardio<strong> ALWAYS</strong> after lifting weights. Do you ever notice when boxers or fighters come out right before a fight they're always sweaty? It's because you want to get warmed up, you want to be loose.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\nThink about a piece of meat in your freezer. If you take it out, and smash it on something it'll break, right? But if it's at room temperature and you smash it on something it'll just bend. That's an extreme example, but most meat is muscle tissue so it works the same way. If you have a cold muscle it's easier to snap and hurt yourself. It's not exactly the same, I know, but you know what the fuck I mean.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/fitness/PublishingImages/COMMON%20EXERCISE%20MISTAKES/bicep-curls.jpg\" width=\"484\" height=\"385\" />\n\nNumber two, proper form. It's not about how much weight you can lift. It's about how much you can work the muscle. So if you're cheating or doing hurkey jerkey shit, one, that jerk movement makes you more <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">susceptible to injury, and you're probably just lifting too much. If you have to do a bicep curl and you got to all types of shit with your back, or you got to lift you elbows up, it's probably too much weight for your bicep.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\n<em><strong>\"But hey man, Arnold did cheat curls.\"</strong></em><span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\nStop comparing yourself to Arnold.

You're just a fucking guy, you're not Arnold Schwarzenegger, shut the fuck up. Well, you can do them if you want to. But when you have to take 2-3 months off and you're icing your arm, remember we had this conversation, because your bicep injury is pretty much inevitable.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://cdn-flex0.heartyhosting.com/sites/flexonline.com/files/styles/node_image/public/FL03047_2014-1.jpg?itok=g8aCe5kN\" width=\"455\" height=\"433\" />\n\nForm is important. I power up on the positive part of the exercise. So lets say you're doing bicep curl, you power going up (positive), and have a controlled motion going down (negative). I l don't go to hard with it, you're<em> lifting</em> weights <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">not lowering weights, but I like to have control coming down because sometimes you can get injury just from letting that shit go.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\nFinally, number three, there's a difference between being <em>sore</em> and being in <em>pain</em>. There's a difference between<em><strong> \"hurts a lot\"</strong></em> and  <strong><em>\"yo I fucked myself up.\"</em></strong> You're going to have to learn the difference, and that's only going to come from trial and error. I can't tell you how it's going to feel for you, but you're going to need to learn those because if it's pain from injury you're going to need to stop otherwise you're going to make it worse.

Motherfuckers love this shit. They don't put it out there because of endorsements or whatever. I mean I don't give a fuck because I endorse myself. I say whatever the fuck I want. Yeah, I smoke weed every once in a while, I get high once in a while, I smoke cigars every once in a while, I jack off all the time. I don't give a fuck. I don't need no motherfucking deals, ain't nobody giving me shit. I go out and get mine.\n\nMotherfuckers you guys know smoke cigarettes. There's pro bodybuilders who smoke cigarettes.

I know, it's weird. Now the science says all of this is bad for you and these guys might just be outliers, right? They can be motherfucking addicts and still get gains. But I wouldn't rely on that if I was you.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://r.ddmcdn.com/s_f/o_1/DSC/uploads/2016/01/liquor-banner-120.jpg\" width=\"548\" height=\"285\" />\n\nAnyway,\n\nI'm on a little vacation in Italy, baller shit. While I've been here I've been smoking Cuban cigars. Maybe like one a day. These cigars are not going to kill me. If you smoke one cigarette every once in a while it's not going to kill you. But, it's <strong>not</strong> good for you. I'm not saying it's okay, I'm just saying<strong> I'm not perfect</strong> and I don't hold myself to that standard of perfection. It's what you do <em>habitually</em> that counts. Habitually, I live a healthy lifestyle. Few times a year I'll have a cigar. Probably less than 10 in the whole year. Is it good for me? Nah. But remember, it's what you do habitually that counts.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.portugaldailyview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/EVI_6891.jpg\" width=\"449\" height=\"327\" />\n\nSo, if you have a cheat day or your favorite food every once in a while it's fine if you can control yourself. If you can't, don't fuck with it. I use to smoke weed like way too much. Now, I only smoke weed maybe every blue moon and it's not a big deal for me. But for some people, all they care about is weed and it seems like it controls them a little bit.\n\nAlcohol is not good for your gains. It'll make you gain weight, lower your testosterone levels, fuck up your gains. If you do it every once in a while it shouldn't be a big deal, the effects should be negligible. But if it becomes a habit, it's going to be a problem.\n\nIf you lift a fucking weight every once in a while, you think you're going to get swole? Nah. Fuck no. If you run every once in a while, you think you're going to get ripped? You think you're going to get shredded? Of course not. But if you habitually lift weights, yeah, you're going to get swole. If you habitually eat right, yeah, you're going to be in great shape. If you habitually do cardio to burn fat, yeah, you're going to get ripped. It's what you do habitually that counts.\n\nListen, alcohol ain't good for you, smoking and everything ain't good for you. But, if you do it every once in a while it shouldn't be a big deal. If it becomes something addictive, something you can't fucking handle and it starts to handle you, then maybe you need to chill.\n\nI remember I used to have a problem with sex. In college it was like 3 girls a day, and not on some pimp shit, it was weird. I felt like I couldn't control myself. I wouldn't go as far as to say I was a sex addict but it was certainly what it felt like. It was never clinically diagnosed. But, I had to check myself with that shit. I had to abstain for a little while because it was in control of me. But sex in itself is not bad, right?\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.rehabs.com/wp-content/uploads/640x425xsex-addiction-research-640x425.jpg.pagespeed.ic.j8ZbTTtFe-.jpg\" width=\"497\" height=\"330\" />\n\nIt all comes down to whether<em> you're</em> in control or is the <em>vice</em> in control? Is it something you want to have every once in a while, or something you need to have all the time?\n\nNone of these things are good for you, but we're not perfect man, we are all fallible, we all make mistakes and for me it's better that I recognize my flaws, minimize them, but I don't ignore them. I know I like nicotine, I know I like cigars every once in a while, I know I like alcohol every once in a while, I know I like smoking weed every once in a while and a few other vices I might not talk about, but I'm in control.\n\nI know the difference between real addiction. My dad had a gambling problem. He had to go, I've seen him miss flights because he was at the table. I've seen him fuck up his business, he had a real problem.\n\nAnyway, I'll holla at ya'll.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzQmG_AIsi4&nbsp;\nYour Friend,\nBig Brandon Carter a.k.a \"BBC\nSnapChat: KillerCarter187","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Here's the thing man.

It's what you do <em>habitually</em> that counts. Habitually, I live a healthy lifestyle. Few times a year I'll have a cigar. Probably less than 10 in the whole year. Is it good for me? Nah. But remember, it's what you do habitually that counts.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.portugaldailyview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/EVI_6891.jpg\" width=\"449\" height=\"327\" /></p>\n\n<p>So, if you have a cheat day or your favorite food every once in a while it's fine if you can control yourself. If you can't, don't fuck with it. I use to smoke weed like way too much. Now, I only smoke weed maybe every blue moon and it's not a big deal for me. But for some people, all they care about is weed and it seems like it controls them a little bit.</p>\n\n<p>Alcohol is not good for your gains. It'll make you gain weight, lower your testosterone levels, fuck up your gains. If you do it every once in a while it shouldn't be a big deal, the effects should be negligible. But if it becomes a habit, it's going to be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>If you lift a fucking weight every once in a while, you think you're going to get swole? Nah. Fuck no. If you run every once in a while, you think you're going to get ripped? You think you're going to get shredded? Of course not. But if you habitually lift weights, yeah, you're going to get swole. If you habitually eat right, yeah, you're going to be in great shape. If you habitually do cardio to burn fat, yeah, you're going to get ripped. It's what you do habitually that counts.</p>\n\n<p>Listen, alcohol ain't good for you, smoking and everything ain't good for you. But, if you do it every once in a while it shouldn't be a big deal. If it becomes something addictive, something you can't fucking handle and it starts to handle you, then maybe you need to chill.</p>\n\n<p>I remember I used to have a problem with sex. In college it was like 3 girls a day, and not on some pimp shit, it was weird. I felt like I couldn't control myself. I wouldn't go as far as to say I was a sex addict but it was certainly what it felt like. It was never clinically diagnosed. But, I had to check myself with that shit. I had to abstain for a little while because it was in control of me. But sex in itself is not bad, right?</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.rehabs.com/wp-content/uploads/640x425xsex-addiction-research-640x425.jpg.pagespeed.ic.j8ZbTTtFe-.jpg\" width=\"497\" height=\"330\" /></p>\n\n<p>It all comes down to whether<em> you're</em> in control or is the <em>vice</em> in control? Is it something you want to have every once in a while, or something you need to have all the time?</p>\n\n<p>None of these things are good for you, but we're not perfect man, we are all fallible, we all make mistakes and for me it's better that I recognize my flaws, minimize them, but I don't ignore them. I know I like nicotine, I know I like cigars every once in a while, I know I like alcohol every once in a while, I know I like smoking weed every once in a while and a few other vices I might not talk about, but I'm in control.</p>\n\n<p>I know the difference between real addiction. My dad had a gambling problem. He had to go, I've seen him miss flights because he was at the table. I've seen him fuck up his business, he had a real problem.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I'll holla at ya'll.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzQmG_AIsi4&nbsp\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzQmG_AIsi4&nbsp</a>; <br />\nYour Friend, <br />\nBig Brandon Carter a.k.a \"BBC <br />\nSnapChat: KillerCarter187</p>","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-06-29 15:59:34","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-06-29 15:59:34","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-06-29 15:59:34","published_by":1},{"id":2064,"uuid":"11c74a08-ab53-4f01-b21e-eeae50705957","title":"The #1 Reason Why You're Still Fat","slug":"the-1-reason-why-youre-still-fat","markdown":"<strong>Yo what up, what up!? </strong>\n<strong>It's your man Big Brandon Carter, I'm out here in Italy. You know what it is.</strong>I just thought that I take a quick minute to explain to you guys something that I get asked about a lot. People always ask me what exercise can I do to burn fat? What exercise can I do to burn my belly? What exercise can I do to burn the fat on my thighs? What exercise can I do to burn fat behind the arms? They'll be guys who say, what exercise do I do to burn fat on my chest?\n\n<em><strong>You can not burn fat in one spot.</strong></em> When you burn fat, you burn it everywhere. There's no exercise you can do to burn fat at all. Exercise alone, for burning fat is almost <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">useless. If all you did was exercise to try to burn fat you're almost guaranteed to fail.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://nowskinny.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lose-fat-fast.jpg\" width=\"458\" height=\"304\" />\n\n<em>Diet</em> is how you burn fat. Remember, you can't burn fat in one spot. All the fat cells will shrink at the same rate and the only way to burn fat is to burn more calories than you consume. That's all it is.\n\nLet me explain why.\n\nThe reason we store fat as humans is because back in the day if you wanted to eat something, you had to grow it or kill it and caveman weren't really good at agriculture and buffaloes didn't like to die. It was very difficult to kill a fucking woolie mammoth with sticks or stones, or whatever those guys had. So what would happen is we would make a <em><strong>\"big kill.\"</strong></em> You throw the stone at the right place, it hits the buffalo right between the eyes and he dies. Then you bring the whole buffalo back to the crew and we going to eat that whole buffalo because we can't store it for later like we could now. The only way they could store it was as fat, to use it as a source of energy during times of <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">caloric scarcity</em>. So, you're body will take in as many calories as it would need to survive and store the rest as fat for later because it still thinks you're a caveman and it doesn't know that you can just eat whenever you want, it believes caloric scarcity is around the corner.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://images.contentful.com/7h71s48744nc/5vevf0pSnY8AkAweSusK2O/7eebe508d3c69b24168927845573af79/10000-bc.jpg\" width=\"613\" height=\"345\" />Remember, this is the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">first time in human history where you can pretty much just eat whenever you wanted, and we do, we eat too much. So basically, the only way to use the fat is to use it for what it's intended for, for times of caloric scarcity. You have to <em>deliberately</em> put yourself in a state of caloric scarcity, meaning you have to put yourself in a caloric deficit.\n\nThe problem is that people try to put themselves in a deficit by exercise. It is the least effective way possible. Just for example, and I know I say the same shit all the time, but it's worth repeating. If you ran a mile, you'd <strong>burn</strong> about a 100 calories on average. There's <em><strong>more</strong></em> than a 100 calories in a fucking banana. So if you eat a banana after your run it's like you didn't even fucking run a mile, you know what I'm saying?\n\nEvery time I talk about diet someone always says<em><strong> \"If you go vegan, you won't have to worry about calories.\"</strong></em> Yo shut the fuck up man. That's bullshit. Now veganism is great for other health concerns, and it's great for the environment, and it's \"morally\" correct. But, you can still eat vegan food in a surplus and get fat.\n\nYou can do an insanity workout 12 hours a day, if you're still consuming more calories than you burn, you <strong>won't</strong> lose a pound. What you have to do is put yourself in some sort of state of caloric restriction. Exercise is a catalyst, it will help you. But if you're only exercising it's not going to do shit, forget about it. But you can diet, and <strong>NOT</strong> exercise and still lose fat. I hate even saying that as a personal trainer, because that's fucking with my money and my business with the HIIT cardio programs that I sell. But it's the fucking truth. I don't want to bullshit you and have you believe that if you just do HIIT cardio or buy one of my cardio programs you'll lose fat, it's not going to work that way. It's all about the diet.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.papertostone.com/q-article//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/04/workout1.jpg\" width=\"513\" height=\"385\" />\n\n<em><strong>NO</strong></em> exercise will burn fat.

A lot of people, when they talk about Intermittent Fasting they act like it's a panacea for everything; it's best for building muscle, it's best for losing fat, it makes your dick hard, cures cancer, all types of shit. It's not. It's going to be good for some people under some circumstances and not ideal for other people in other circumstances.\n\nHere's a few circumstances I think are not optimal for Intermittent Fasting:\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.getholistichealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/9890edb1286d4e18ac9b547d6d76dddd.jpg\" width=\"372\" height=\"372\" />\n\nOne would be if you're trying to put on muscle and you're just a skinny guy naturally or skinny woman naturally. Here's the thing, I do intermittent fasting when I'm bulking, I just get my surplus during the feeding window. That's the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">best way I know to stay ripped while putting on muscle, gaining weight with as <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">little fat as possible. But putting on the muscle is <em>slower</em> than if you were just eating around the clock. That's because when you're eating a constant supply of protein and amino acids you're going to be in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">higher protein synthesis, meaning you're pretty much going to be putting on muscle faster, your muscle going to recover faster and grow quicker. If you're restricting your protein synthesis to 8 hours it's going to be slower. So if staying lean is not a problem for you, and you want to just put on as much as muscle as soon as possible, then intermittent fasting is not ideal under those circumstances.\n\nIt's good to bulk with intermittent fasting if staying lean when bulking is a problem for you. If you're one of those guys that gets fat every time he bulks than this is your best bet.\n\nIn fact, when I was younger I was real skinny and I had a hard time putting on any muscle at all, and I made crazy gains when I woke up in the middle of the night (I set an alarm) and had a protein shake. So I had one before I went to sleep, then one in the middle of the night, then another one as soon as I woke up. So I was getting protein 24 hours a day and I was getting bigger a lot quicker. But I'm in my 30's now and my metabolism is a lot slower, a lot of guys at this age start getting the gut, I ain't fucking with so I like to bulk on intermittent fasting. Putting on muscle is slower <strong>I shit you not</strong>, but you will stay leaner.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://upl.stack.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/drills.jpeg\" width=\"478\" height=\"337\" />\n\nThe second circumstance that is not ideal is for anyone trying to exceed in any sport or athletic en devour. Training for <em>athletics</em> and training for<em> aesthetics</em> are two totally different things with two totally different protocols. I've trained some guys in the NFL and honestly we didn't give a fuck about how they looked, it was all about performance. So there's no way that I would have them on an intermittent fasting protocol, we want them to get stronger quick, recover quick, so they can train harder again sooner. We weren't fucking restricting their calories or protein to an 8 hour feeding window. We had them eating a fucking ton of food all the time. Especially because we were training them 2-3 times a day. So all that cardio, all that weight lifting, they needed a constant supply of calories. I actually think if you are serious about a sport I don't even think it's good to be extra extra lean, unless it's track. But. the guys in the NFL they don't be in single digit body fat. I mean they're lean, especially by normal person standards, but not by bodybuilding standards, and that's good, we don't give a fuck about that. We care about performance.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://mustbethistalltoride.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/man-shrugging-shoulders.jpg\" width=\"435\" height=\"246\" />\n\nAnother circumstance where intermittent fasting is not ideal when <strong>you just don't want to do this shit</strong>. You don't have to. People were getting ripped when everybody was eating 6 meals a day. You don't need to do intermittent fasting, it's just a tool. Some people act like you got to do it, like if you're not doing intermittent fasting, you ain't shit. I might be the best for that guy, but it might not be the best for everyone, and that's cool.\n\nThe reason some people become idealogs about this is because, when all you have is a hammer every problem looks like a nail, but to build a house you need more than a hammer, you need fucking all types of tools, right? So it's going to be one tool in your tool belt, but don't act like it's the end all or be all to bodybuilding or aesthetic success.\n\nSome people take a hybrid approach. They do a much more traditional bulk, just eating around the clock, and intermittent fasting during their cut. Some people do the opposite. It's whatever man, it's whatever works for you.\n\nIf you want to know more about Intermittent Fasting I wrote a <a href=\"https://brandoncarter.clickfunnels.com/optin8910636\">book</a> about it, it's 100% free, fuck with it.

If I hadn't had any nutrients to supply myself energy all day what seem to happen when I have a big meal is I get tired because you're body uses energy to digest the food and then there is nothing left, you get lethargic.

Depending on where you are in the world, from what I understand, the fasting window is different. For some it may be longer, something like 18 hours. I would <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">lower intensity because odds are you are not going to be able to get in a surplus during that small feeding window so you're probably going to be in a deficit. So I would try to focus on a cut, lower the intensity of the workout, still lift heavy so you can retain as much muscle as possible. If you don't lift your body is going to be like<em><strong> \"oh we don't need this?\"</strong></em> and it will get rid of it, because the body doesn't want to carry around extra weight, especially if you are in a deficit it is going to try get rid of everything.

Well, with a High Intensity Interval Training Program (also known as HIIT Workout Plan) you can do just that, burn more fat while spending less time in the gym. In this article I will explain how to get the best results from this new and cutting-edge type of cardiovascular training.\n\nYou have probably been told, just like the rest of us, that in order to burn the greatest amount of fat you need to do cardio for 20 to 60 minutes at a moderate intensity. This will indeed melt the fat away, but HIIT is a more efficient and athlete-friendly way to train and burn fat at the same time.\n\n<strong>How HIIT Works</strong>\n\nWith HIIT, you will be working harder than you normally work but for about a quarter to a half of the time that you would normally spend on the cardio machine of your choice. HIIT is so intense and effective that you only need 15 to 20 minutes, tops!\n\n<strong>Here's What You Do:</strong>\n\nFor an efficient HIIT Workout Plan pick the cardio machine of your choice (treadmill, elliptical, rower, bike, swimming) and perform a 5 minute warm-up.\n\nThen take time to stretch properly and you are ready to begin.\n\nStart at a moderate pace for 1 minute, then crank up the pace to 90 or 95% of your Maximum Heart Rate (MHR).\n\nContinue at this effort for 15 to 20 seconds, then slow down to your starting pace for another minute followed by another all-out sprint for 15 to 20 seconds.\n\nOr do like me and jump as high as you can, as fast as you can for 30 sec and rest for 30 sec\n\nDo this for no more than 15 minutes.\n\nAfter that finish your workout by cooling down for 5 minutes and thoroughly stretch afterwards.\n\nIf you perform this right I guarantee that you will be totally exhausted after 20 minutes of this.\n\n<strong>Benefits Of HIIT</strong>\n\nA study at Laval University in Quebec, Canada found that HIIT cardio helped trainees loose nine (yes, 9!) times more fat than those who trained the traditional way (moderate speed for 20-60 minutes). Combine HIIT with your weight program and you boost your metabolism through the roof!\n\n<strong>The Reason HIIT Workout Plans are So Successful Is This</strong>:\n\nWhen you work at a high intensity, you burn more total calories per pound of body weight.\nHigh Intensity workouts such as weight training and HIIT boost growth hormone levels.\nElevates the body's metabolism throughout the entire day!\n\nWhat does this mean for you? The more calories that you burn in a day, the more weight you are able to lose. Even if weight loss is not your goal, HIIT is for you. Athletes will see better gains from doing HIIT cardio as opposed to traditional cardio.\n\nUnless you are training for a marathon, you do not keep a constant pace during your sport. All sports whether it be soccer or football, even baseball or basketball have a point where you need to change gears and hit a full sprint.\n\nHIIT will not only help your cardiovascular system, but will train the anaerobic ATP/CP system as well. Not only will you increase your cardiovascular endurance, but improve your raw speed and explosiveness as well!\n\n<strong>What Is ATP?</strong>\nOtherwise known as Adenosine TriPhosphate, ATP is critical to the release of energy. ATP is an adenosine-derived nucleotide that supplies large amounts of energy to cells for various biochemical processes, including muscle contraction and sugar metabolism, through its hydrolysis to ADP.\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n\nI will let the study speak for itself. A strong HIIT workout plan provides a more effective workout in much less time! Everyone can benefit from HIIT cardio, whether it be the person who is trying to lose weight or the professional football player training for the upcoming NFL season! Give HIIT a try and I am sure that you will not go back to the traditional way of performing cardio again!\n\nSo we have two options for you:\n\n1.

Eat often\nThis should be a no brainer but some people literally have to set their Blackberry to beep when it is time to eat. When we eat we burn calories (thermogenic effect of eating) and we end up less hungry later. Skip meals and you are setting the stage to overeat at your next meal. So, do what it takes to remember to eat often.\n\n2. Take Green Tea\nGreen tea extract when combined with caffeine, increases energy expenditure (calories burned). Studies have also shown that habitual green tea consumers are better able to maintain their weight.\nResearchers have theorized that weight maintenance is easier due to increased thermogenesis and fat oxidation. Tea has a multitude of other benefits as well so you can't go wrong with adding tea to your diet. If you prefer, try an energy drink with green tea extract and caffeine.\n\nI prefer <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme\">TEA REXX</a>, I take it everyday!!!)\n\n3. Be Wary Of Sugar Free Products\nHow many people do you know who chew packs of sugar free gum or candies so they won't eat? Sounds like a good idea, especially the sugar free kind. The thing is, many sugar free gums and candies have sugar alcohols in them which can cause bloating and abdominal discomfort.\nIn large quantities, they can also cause a laxative effect in some people. Many sugar alcohols are known by their \"-ol\" ending: mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, maltitol. Mannitol is the worst offender when it comes to gas and bloating.\n\n4. Quit Boozing\nIf you are going to drink alcohol, at least drink wine and get a few antioxidants. But seriously, cut the alcohol.\n\nDo you know anyone who has ripped abs and still drinks on a regular basis (and yes, weekly counts as regularly!)?

When we eat we burn calories (thermogenic effect of eating) and we end up less hungry later. Skip meals and you are setting the stage to overeat at your next meal. So, do what it takes to remember to eat often.</p></li>\n<li><p>Take Green Tea <br />\nGreen tea extract when combined with caffeine, increases energy expenditure (calories burned). Studies have also shown that habitual green tea consumers are better able to maintain their weight. <br />\nResearchers have theorized that weight maintenance is easier due to increased thermogenesis and fat oxidation. Tea has a multitude of other benefits as well so you can't go wrong with adding tea to your diet. If you prefer, try an energy drink with green tea extract and caffeine.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I prefer <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme\">TEA REXX</a>, I take it everyday!!!)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Be Wary Of Sugar Free Products <br />\nHow many people do you know who chew packs of sugar free gum or candies so they won't eat? Sounds like a good idea, especially the sugar free kind. The thing is, many sugar free gums and candies have sugar alcohols in them which can cause bloating and abdominal discomfort. <br />\nIn large quantities, they can also cause a laxative effect in some people. Many sugar alcohols are known by their \"-ol\" ending: mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, maltitol. Mannitol is the worst offender when it comes to gas and bloating.</p></li>\n<li><p>Quit Boozing <br />\nIf you are going to drink alcohol, at least drink wine and get a few antioxidants. But seriously, cut the alcohol.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Do you know anyone who has ripped abs and still drinks on a regular basis (and yes, weekly counts as regularly!)?

The secret isn't a thousand sit-ups or even using the latest ab exerciser promoted on a Saturday morning infomercial.\n<h3>Keys for Building Strong Abs and Losing Abdominal Fat</h3>\nYou can have the greatest, most muscular set of abs in the world, but if they are blanketed by a layer of body fat, they are going to be out of sight. In order to rid yourself of the extra body fat around your midsection, you need to incorporate effective cardio sessions into your fitness plan. You cannot spot-reduce the midsection by doing extra ab exercises like crunches or sit-ups. You must first burn off the body fat through proper cardio to properly define the area.Abdominal training by itself will not do much. Cardio needs to be intense enough to do the trick. Three to four sessions a week of intense jogging, running, using the Stairmaster, jumping rope, or biking should be enough to get the process in gear. Swimming, hiking, and taking aerobics classes are beneficial as well. Nothing beats jogging or running. It is the most intense, efficient, and effective method of burning calories. If running outside hurts your joints, try running inside on a treadmill or outside on a dirt path. It definitely is easier on the body.\n\nAgain, you NEED three to four intense cardio sessions a week to help create a calorie deficit and help rid the body of the fat that covers your abs.\n\nWhen it comes to a high-speed cardio session, HIIT cardio is as intense as they come.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr6DuNMTQBc\n<h3>Proper Nutrition</h3>\nDo not sabotage your results in the gym by giving yourself a passport to pig out. Ridding the body of fat once and for all is accomplished by proper nutrition even more so than incorporating cardio. At the end of the day, if you have consumed more calories than you have expended, you add body fat. You need to burn more calories than you consume.\n\nNutrition is important because you can reduce the amount of calories you take in, therefore greatly having an effect on the amount which you have to expend through cardio. Eat five to six small, well-balanced meals spaced apart about every two to three hours. Try to keep something healthy on hand.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/23135111/salmon-body-building-food.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1915\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/23135111/salmon-body-building-food-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"salmon-body-building-food\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nIf not, when you become real hungry, you will opt for something that isn't as good for you. When you become overly hungry, all rational thinking goes out the window.\n\nBut it is important to get something in you. Not eating on time or at all is almost as bad as eating too much. Keep protein intake high (approximately 50% of daily calories), carbs moderate (40%), and fats minimal (10%).\n\nMuscle fiber is made of tightly-wounded protein molecules that is damaged during a workout, so you need more protein than the sedentary person to help that muscle tissue repair itself. Carbohydrates have an important role in the body, but do not base your meals on them. Try to avoid simple sugars like cane sugar, honey, fruit juices, syrups, and even a lot of fruit.\n\nDrink at least a gallon of clean water each day as well. It will help in nutrient absorption and digestion and will help flush toxins from the body.\n\nBottom line, make sure you are supplying your body with well-balanced, healthy food every two to three hours.\n<h3>Weight Training the Abdominals</h3>\nHere is where most people go wrong in their attempt to develop their abs. I often ask those I train, \"Would you train your biceps with sets of 50 reps with no weight?\" Of course, they say \"no.\" How about your chest, 50 reps with no weights? Another \"no.\" I then ask, \"Then why would you do that with your abs?\"\n\nHere's an important key: if you want proper ab development, you need to add resistance (weight) to your ab exercises. Abs are muscles just like biceps, triceps, pecs, glutes, etc. You need resistance to properly strengthen and build them. The same goes for abdominals.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCmYqgrDKQk\n<h3>Get Rock Hard Abs Now</h3>\nStart by <a href=\"http://brolabsmealplan.com/\">customizing a meal plan</a> to ensure you stay on track with the foods you eat to fuel your body.

We talk about when you should be doing intermittent fasting, when you should be eating and how much in our program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>.\n\nThe reason we're talking about cardio and six packs today is because you can have the strongest abs in the world, but until you can cut your bodyfat down you just won't be able to see them.\n\nWhen it comes to a six-pack, fat is a little bit like a blanket. It fills in all the great lines and ridges that you want. Cardio gives you an opportunity to cut that fat so you can see the awesome.\n<h3>Kinds of Cardio Training</h3>\nThere are a couple different kinds of cardio training. I am a huge fan of High Intensity Interval training. It really taxes your system for a short period but creates a long calorie burn after you're done.\n\nHeart-rate training is something endurance athletes do. The idea of heart-rate training is to get your heart used to training at higher levels without working harder. This kind of cardio is great for marathon runners because they never get to an oxygen deficit. When you're breathing hard, your body asks you to slow down so the muscles can catch up. This is neither a muscle building or fat loss plan.\n\nTimed cardio training is when you decide to run for 30 minutes/day or get in a daily jog. Running for running sake isn't really an athletic endeavor, it's a fat loss task. Just going out to run for 30 minutes doesn't make you faster, doesn't make your heart more efficient and doesn't build muscle. But it is a great way to burn calories if you're trying to lose weight.\n<h3>What about the fat?</h3>\nWhen your body is in fat storing mode it stores the fat all over your body at once, at the same time. The idea that you can just lose fat around your waist or your midsection is false. You can't do exercises to \"spot reduce\".\n\nTherefore 1,000's of ab exercises to get rid of just ab fat is ridiculous. You need to place your body is a state of negative caloric burn. If you eat 2,000 calories then workout and only burn 1,000 you can't lose fat. Your body still has readily available calories to use for energy.\n\nSo you need to make sure that during the cut phase, when you're trying to eliminate the fat to make your abs pop-out, that you're eating 2,000 calories but burning 3,000 calories.\n<h3>What's next?</h3>\nIf you really want to get ripped, this is a good place to start. But starting ain't the same as success. If you really want it, then grab my program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>. Don't think about it.

Cardio needs to be intense enough to do the trick.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some Cardio and abdominal workouts for a six pack that will have your abs so you're ready for the next impromptu beach outing.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/12e70RccYvM\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g1CnDj9IK0s\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yphxh8nHP8M\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>  \n\n<h3>The Path to A Six Pack</h3>  \n\n<p>The only real way to burn fat and build muscle is through a purposeful diet. We talk about when you should be doing intermittent fasting, when you should be eating and how much in our program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The reason we're talking about cardio and six packs today is because you can have the strongest abs in the world, but until you can cut your bodyfat down you just won't be able to see them.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to a six-pack, fat is a little bit like a blanket. It fills in all the great lines and ridges that you want. Cardio gives you an opportunity to cut that fat so you can see the awesome.  </p>\n\n<h3>Kinds of Cardio Training</h3>  \n\n<p>There are a couple different kinds of cardio training. I am a huge fan of High Intensity Interval training. It really taxes your system for a short period but creates a long calorie burn after you're done.</p>\n\n<p>Heart-rate training is something endurance athletes do. The idea of heart-rate training is to get your heart used to training at higher levels without working harder. This kind of cardio is great for marathon runners because they never get to an oxygen deficit. When you're breathing hard, your body asks you to slow down so the muscles can catch up. This is neither a muscle building or fat loss plan.</p>\n\n<p>Timed cardio training is when you decide to run for 30 minutes/day or get in a daily jog. Running for running sake isn't really an athletic endeavor, it's a fat loss task. Just going out to run for 30 minutes doesn't make you faster, doesn't make your heart more efficient and doesn't build muscle. But it is a great way to burn calories if you're trying to lose weight.  </p>\n\n<h3>What about the fat?</h3>  \n\n<p>When your body is in fat storing mode it stores the fat all over your body at once, at the same time. The idea that you can just lose fat around your waist or your midsection is false. You can't do exercises to \"spot reduce\".</p>\n\n<p>Therefore 1,000's of ab exercises to get rid of just ab fat is ridiculous. You need to place your body is a state of negative caloric burn. If you eat 2,000 calories then workout and only burn 1,000 you can't lose fat. Your body still has readily available calories to use for energy.</p>\n\n<p>So you need to make sure that during the cut phase, when you're trying to eliminate the fat to make your abs pop-out, that you're eating 2,000 calories but burning 3,000 calories.  </p>\n\n<h3>What's next?</h3>  \n\n<p>If you really want to get ripped, this is a good place to start. But starting ain't the same as success. If you really want it, then grab my program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>. Don't think about it. Just get it done.</p>","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-01-23 03:14:05","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2010-01-23 03:14:05","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-01-23 03:14:05","published_by":1},{"id":2075,"uuid":"3bb14a84-c959-4b53-953d-0f15aefa00ec","title":"Home Gym Equipment for Arms","slug":"arm-workouts-bicep-and-tripe","markdown":"I canceled my gym member ship!

In order to rid yourself of the extra body fat around your midsection, you need to incorporate effective cardio sessions into your fitness plan.\n\nYou cannot spot-reduce the midsection by doing extra ab exercises like crunches or sit-ups. You first must burn off the body fat through proper cardio to properly define the area. But you don't have to go to the gym, a great home abs workout will be perfect.\n\nNevertheless, abdominal training by itself will not do much. Cardio needs to be intense enough to do the trick. Three to four sessions a week of intense jogging, running, the Stairmaster, the elliptical, jumping rope, or biking should be enough to get the process in gear. Swimming, hiking, and taking aerobics classes are beneficial as well. Nothing beats jogging or running.\n\nIt is the most intense, efficient, and effective method of burning calories. If running outside hurts your joints, try running inside on a treadmill or outside on a dirt path. It definitely is easier on the body.\n\nAgain, you NEED three to four intense cardio sessions a week to help create a calorie deficit and help rid the body of the fat that covers your abs.\n\nProper Nutrition:\n\nIt's hard to only exercise at home. Abs Workouts alone won't do it though. Do not sabotage your results in the gym by giving yourself a passport to pig out. Ridding the body of fat once and for all is accomplished by proper nutrition more so than incorporating cardio. At the end of the day, if you have consumed more calories than you have expended, you add body fat. So you need to burn more calories than you consume.\n\nNutrition is important because you can reduce the amount of calories you take in, therefore greatly having an effect on the amount which you have to expend through cardio. Eat five to six small, well-balanced meals spaced apart about every three to four hours. Try to keep something healthy on hand.\n\nIf not, when you become real hungry, you will opt for something that isn't as good for you. When you become overly hungry, all rational thinking goes out the window.\n\nBut it is important to get something in you. Not eating on time or at all is almost as bad as eating too much. Keep protein intake high (approximately 50% of daily calories), carbs moderate (40%), and fats minimal (10%).\n\nMuscle fiber is made of tightly-wound protein molecules that is damaged during a workout, so you need more protein than the sedentary person to help that muscle tissue repair. Carbohydrates have an important role in the body, but do not base your meals on them. Try to avoid simple sugars like cane sugar, honey, fruit juices, syrups, and even a lot of fruit.\n\nDrink at least a gallon of clean water each day as well. It will help in nutrient absorption and digestion and will help flush toxins from the body.\n\nBottom line, make sure you are supplying your body with well-balanced, healthy food every three to four hours.\n\nWeight Training The Abdominals:\n\nHere is where most people go wrong in their attempt to develop their abs. I often ask those I train, \"Would you train your biceps with sets of 50 reps with no weight?\" Of course, they say \"no.\" How about your chest, 50 reps with no weight? Another no. I then ask, \"Then why would you do that with your abs?\"\n\nHere's an important key. If you want proper ab development, you need to add resistance (weight) to your ab exercises. At the gym there are machines, so you have to modify a bit at home to get resistance. Part of our home abs workout plan is resistance bands. Anchor a resistance band under a door, and you can loop that around your chest while you do sit-ups.\n\nFind resistance and you'll build.\n\nSo we offer you two options:\n\n1 Read more on our <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/category/home-workout\">home workout plans</a>.\n\n2. <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">CLICK HERE TO GET MY PROGRAM THE SIMPLE SHREDDED SOLUTION</a>!!!","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/00PlmvrExrY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Your Home Abs Workout: Key to getting a six pack:</p>\n\n<p>You can have the greatest, most muscular set of abs in the world, but if they are blanketed by a layer of body fat, who cares.

It's one of the many workouts in our 4 Week Booty Boot Camp: Butt and Thigh Program, which is a plan that lays out exactly which workouts to lift and shape the butt, tone the thighs, increase cardiovascular health, and reduce overall body fat (just to name a few of the many benefits).\n\nAfter a quick warm up, we move into an intense cardio interval combination of two different exercises that focus on the lower body as well as your cardiovascular endurance levels, then top it off with a strength move that targets the butt and thighs as well; repeat each of these groups twice before moving onto the next. After 5 fat blasting rounds of that, we move into a Pilates burnout round, just to really get every last ounce of benefit from this workout session.\n\nThis workout is not for beginners. It’s challenging but it’s fun - just make sure that you listen to your own body as you go through it (no matter how fit you might be), either taking extra breaks or lowering the amount of weight you’re lifting for each rep. On the other hand, there’s really no instance in which this workout should be “too easy”. If you’ve tried it and it felt too easy, it’s highly likely that either your form was wrong, or you weren’t lifting heavily enough during the strength portions, or pushing yourself hard enough during the cardio intervals. It’s up to you to make these workouts as relevant to your fitness level as possible, so stay tuned in; listen to your body and make sure that you stay present enough that you’re able to stop yourself if you catch yourself slacking or not working as hard as you could be.\n\n<strong>Printable Cardio Interval / Butt and Thigh Workout </strong>\nWarm Up (25 seconds each)\nBoxer Shuffle\nToe Touch Sweeps\nSide Step Jacks\nKnee + Kick\nGood Mornings\nLateral Hops\nAlternating Lunges\nSquats\nPivot Squats\nButt Kickers\n\n<strong>Cardio Intervals &amp; Strength (30 on 10 off, AB, + 8 strength reps, X 2)</strong>\nReverse Lunge Sumo Drops\n3 Lateral Hops + Jump\n8 Sumo Deadlifts\n\nSide Squat + Ski Squat + Jumps\nBurpee + Knee\n8 Squats\n\nWater Break\n\n3 Fast Feet Counts + Drop, 3 Fast Feet Counts + Jump\nJump Squat + High Side Kick\n8 Alternating Lunges\n\n180 Squat Drops\nBody Drop Back Bows\n8 Deadlifts\n\nCurtsy Lunges + Calf Raises\nSquat Pulses\nWeighted Bridge\n\n<strong>Freestyle Pilates Burnout</strong>\nKneeling Leg Raises + Pulses\nBack Bows\nInside Thigh Raises\nOutside Thigh Raises\n\n<strong>Cool Down &amp; Stretch</strong>\n\nWhat did you guys think of this workout?

It's one of the many workouts in our 4 Week Booty Boot Camp: Butt and Thigh Program, which is a plan that lays out exactly which workouts to lift and shape the butt, tone the thighs, increase cardiovascular health, and reduce overall body fat (just to name a few of the many benefits).</p>\n\n<p>After a quick warm up, we move into an intense cardio interval combination of two different exercises that focus on the lower body as well as your cardiovascular endurance levels, then top it off with a strength move that targets the butt and thighs as well; repeat each of these groups twice before moving onto the next. After 5 fat blasting rounds of that, we move into a Pilates burnout round, just to really get every last ounce of benefit from this workout session.</p>\n\n<p>This workout is not for beginners. It’s challenging but it’s fun - just make sure that you listen to your own body as you go through it (no matter how fit you might be), either taking extra breaks or lowering the amount of weight you’re lifting for each rep. On the other hand, there’s really no instance in which this workout should be “too easy”. If you’ve tried it and it felt too easy, it’s highly likely that either your form was wrong, or you weren’t lifting heavily enough during the strength portions, or pushing yourself hard enough during the cardio intervals. It’s up to you to make these workouts as relevant to your fitness level as possible, so stay tuned in; listen to your body and make sure that you stay present enough that you’re able to stop yourself if you catch yourself slacking or not working as hard as you could be.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Printable Cardio Interval / Butt and Thigh Workout </strong> <br />\nWarm Up (25 seconds each) <br />\nBoxer Shuffle <br />\nToe Touch Sweeps <br />\nSide Step Jacks <br />\nKnee + Kick <br />\nGood Mornings <br />\nLateral Hops <br />\nAlternating Lunges <br />\nSquats <br />\nPivot Squats <br />\nButt Kickers</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cardio Intervals &amp; Strength (30 on 10 off, AB, + 8 strength reps, X 2)</strong> <br />\nReverse Lunge Sumo Drops <br />\n3 Lateral Hops + Jump <br />\n8 Sumo Deadlifts</p>\n\n<p>Side Squat + Ski Squat + Jumps <br />\nBurpee + Knee <br />\n8 Squats</p>\n\n<p>Water Break</p>\n\n<p>3 Fast Feet Counts + Drop, 3 Fast Feet Counts + Jump <br />\nJump Squat + High Side Kick <br />\n8 Alternating Lunges</p>\n\n<p>180 Squat Drops <br />\nBody Drop Back Bows <br />\n8 Deadlifts</p>\n\n<p>Curtsy Lunges + Calf Raises <br />\nSquat Pulses <br />\nWeighted Bridge</p>\n\n<p><strong>Freestyle Pilates Burnout</strong> <br />\nKneeling Leg Raises + Pulses <br />\nBack Bows <br />\nInside Thigh Raises <br />\nOutside Thigh Raises</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cool Down &amp; Stretch</strong></p>\n\n<p>What did you guys think of this workout?

I know a lot of ya'll want to put on a little bit of muscle, you know, take your shirt off, stunt at the beach and what not.\n\nBut you also want to stay hoe ready, I'm sorry...<em>\"young lady\"</em> ready. So how do you put on muscle and stay lean all summer?\n\nFirst of all, what you want to do is get as <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">lean as you want to be. You should have visible cuts, six pack, or at least the making of a six pack. There's a few reasons you want to do that.\n\nOne, it's just quicker to lose fat than to build muscle. Biologically, putting on muscle is just a more difficult process. The muscle fibers have to be broken down and then they have to heal and then cells actually have to grow and then split. All fat cells have to do is just<em> shrink</em>. I have a video where I interview a guy who lost <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EkR2Kwzor0\">70 pounds in 70 days</a>, under no circumstances are you putting on 70 pounds of muscle in 70 days, even if you're on all types of juice or drugs it doesn't matter, there's <strong>NO WAY IN HELL</strong> you're doing that. I say that to say, getting cut is faster.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://photos-6.dropbox.com/t/2/AADHG117q2RwJTKBlney1J6MEFJWideX4egFc5KTzruqUA/12/479780791/jpeg/256x256/1/_/1/2/IMG_4444.JPG/EI6p3fEDGNObAiAHKAc/JL7cwhg_J3NGZoHwB1aOPXpeLX2jy-dQ86y7Knsq_kE%2CB-B3UzzgIdd0NZaFZow1tEzzK_eTkHoWq6MgNCmRPLM?size_mode=3&amp;size=2048x1536\" width=\"518\" height=\"346\" />\n\nThen do what I call <em>(I think I invented this)</em> <strong>Micro-Bulks</strong>. Basically what you do is, you just bulk for a few weeks. Usually 2-4 weeks, it can be longer or shorter, you judge it by your abs. When your six pack starts fading or you're not as ripped, then you cut.\n\nNow. this is different than a traditional bulk. In a traditional bulk what happens is you bulk for long periods of time, you put on a lot of weight, and you might get kind of fat, and that's cool, it works. You actually put on <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">more muscle </em>that way. But like I said you'll get kind of fat and that's not what this blog is about. This blog's about staying lean.\n\nI do this process year round, because I don't want to ever be fat and it's easier to stay lean if you're already lean and you are more susceptible to put on fat if you're already fat. The fatter you are the worse it can potentially get.\n\nSo basically what I do is first, I get lean. Then I bulk until my abs start looking whack, but only<strong> START</strong> looking whack, they're not actually whack yet. Then I go back on a cut, and I kind of go back and fourth between the two.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Good Rule of Thumb:</strong>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">If you're cutting, take your weight in pounds, multiply it by 10, that's how many calories you need to cut.</strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">If you want to bulk take you're weight, multiply it by 20, that's how many calories you need to bulk.</strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Or you can use the <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">portion size method</strong> that I talk about in some of my videos..</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://photos-2.dropbox.com/t/2/AACokmyT22dJ9LlnpSftyXWhF3e7_M3YMebYOZOMg8paPA/12/479780791/jpeg/256x256/1/_/1/2/IMG_4934.JPG/EI6p3fEDGNObAiAHKAc/pujncB8AKvUgWHFGZpN8dFT1ZADhro4FkTKPR2-uenU%2CMwVKd6HEbAcs68xB9bL1KYV6reFAtFgI4jsRbxcycnA?size_mode=3&amp;size=2048x1536\" width=\"660\" height=\"439\" />.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now, people get crazy when I talk about stuff like this.

I'm going to tell you a quick story about that..<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\nI was in the park filming some Youtube video or something and then we saw this guy and he was dancing crazy by himself and I started snapping him and making fun of him, because it was hilarious to me. Then I just started dancing with him <em><strong>(pause)</strong></em> and started acting crazy with him. Then after it I was tired from these weird dances, we were doing them for a while, they were hilarious to me. I started talking to him when we were done. He wasn't crazy,<strong> he was a regular guy</strong>. In fact he was more than a regular guy, he was an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Environmental Engineer. I thought he was crazy, but he's really saving the fucking planet. He told me he had a fitbit on and he was doing these dances to burn a certain number of calories each day because he <em>hated traditional cardio</em>. He hated running or going to the gym  or something silly like that. He just liked to dance, it was fun to him. He didn't care what no one thought and I went from thinking he's a crazy person to actually admiring him and thinking that he was borderline brilliant.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://photos-5.dropbox.com/t/2/AAB1dEZFclY4-eq2KQXb7WQvvScVQEHmv9zFi-rGsRitHw/12/479780791/jpeg/256x256/1/_/1/2/IMG_8343.JPG/EI6p3fEDGNObAiAHKAc/u-Hjp-GL93zUE5vJXyd2dU8KkVUhgzufjhwFgCnS6VE%2CKR6ZmUtXUZ62mHh3CHZseccog2t_jAmKMFZXdWkhFik?size_mode=3&amp;size=2048x1536\" width=\"472\" height=\"314\" />\n\nI say all of this to say, if you don't like cardio, you got to find the cardio that you do like. This guy likes to dance, who doesn't like to dance, right? Get out there and dance!\n\nJust try to make it fun.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\nAnother thing you can do is to workout with friends. Find a workout partner, working with them will motivate you and just make it more fun and interesting and you won't despise it so much and then you'll push each other and encourage each other. It's a lot easier to just not do it, when it's just you. When you know someone else is keeping you accountable it's a lot easier to stay accountable because<em> humans thrive on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">consistency.</em>  <span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://photos-3.dropbox.com/t/2/AAAjCkPFrMT7FifIBlDKEKrM1Ifv7TZOoHugkrcjDBNuug/12/479780791/jpeg/256x256/1/_/1/2/DSC09369.JPG/EI6p3fEDGNObAiAHKAc/kwyneH4irWvQluOKWBKlBB5T6VunLe4mWXtus11q4Ws%2CXZSnN9Xph5Isf3ItF-N6TCjJN4H0QfKbc21qWf-QDMs?size_mode=3&amp;size=2048x1536\" width=\"523\" height=\"294\" />\n\nAnother thing to do is to work out in groups. If you can find some friends and ya'll can go out and train together. We actually do <strong>FREE</strong> boot camps in New York every summer. I've been doing it for the past two years and they've been a lot of fun and they're coming back soon so go to <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" data-referer-safe=\"1\" data-referer-original-href=\"http://brandoncarter.com\">Brandoncarter.com</a> and signup for my mailing list so you don't miss out on that. We already got the permits to do it in <em><strong>Central Park</strong></em>. We might be doing it in some other cities. But even if you can't come to one of our events, start your own events, get a bunch of your friends together and be like<em><strong> \"Hey man, we're working out, we're going to the park\"</strong></em> That's what a lot of the street work out guys do. They all work out together.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://photos-1.dropbox.com/t/2/AAACqMCZ35OzKhZNVnNUdpg1mb5X1G9m8ddgts9_mGJURA/12/479780791/jpeg/256x256/1/_/1/2/DSC08889.JPG/EI6p3fEDGNObAiAHKAc/kPlnIdMwm9a1I3JnoNfb-tF3xW4bYQDQlcPTNVK1y78?size_mode=3&amp;size=2048x1536\" width=\"567\" height=\"319\" />\n\nFinally man, if you really just hate it, find a way you can get into a sport.

I'm going to tell you a quick story about that..<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\"> <br />\n</i></p>\n\n<p>I was in the park filming some Youtube video or something and then we saw this guy and he was dancing crazy by himself and I started snapping him and making fun of him, because it was hilarious to me. Then I just started dancing with him <em><strong>(pause)</strong></em> and started acting crazy with him. Then after it I was tired from these weird dances, we were doing them for a while, they were hilarious to me. I started talking to him when we were done. He wasn't crazy,<strong> he was a regular guy</strong>. In fact he was more than a regular guy, he was an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Environmental Engineer. I thought he was crazy, but he's really saving the fucking planet. He told me he had a fitbit on and he was doing these dances to burn a certain number of calories each day because he <em>hated traditional cardio</em>. He hated running or going to the gym  or something silly like that. He just liked to dance, it was fun to him. He didn't care what no one thought and I went from thinking he's a crazy person to actually admiring him and thinking that he was borderline brilliant.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\"> <br />\n</i></p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://photos-5.dropbox.com/t/2/AAB1dEZFclY4-eq2KQXb7WQvvScVQEHmv9zFi-rGsRitHw/12/479780791/jpeg/256x256/1/_/1/2/IMG_8343.JPG/EI6p3fEDGNObAiAHKAc/u-Hjp-GL93zUE5vJXyd2dU8KkVUhgzufjhwFgCnS6VE%2CKR6ZmUtXUZ62mHh3CHZseccog2t_jAmKMFZXdWkhFik?size_mode=3&amp;size=2048x1536\" width=\"472\" height=\"314\" /></p>\n\n<p>I say all of this to say, if you don't like cardio, you got to find the cardio that you do like. This guy likes to dance, who doesn't like to dance, right? Get out there and dance!</p>\n\n<p>Just try to make it fun.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\"> <br />\n</i></p>\n\n<p>Another thing you can do is to workout with friends. Find a workout partner, working with them will motivate you and just make it more fun and interesting and you won't despise it so much and then you'll push each other and encourage each other. It's a lot easier to just not do it, when it's just you. When you know someone else is keeping you accountable it's a lot easier to stay accountable because<em> humans thrive on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">consistency.</em>  <span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\"> <br />\n</i></p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://photos-3.dropbox.com/t/2/AAAjCkPFrMT7FifIBlDKEKrM1Ifv7TZOoHugkrcjDBNuug/12/479780791/jpeg/256x256/1/_/1/2/DSC09369.JPG/EI6p3fEDGNObAiAHKAc/kwyneH4irWvQluOKWBKlBB5T6VunLe4mWXtus11q4Ws%2CXZSnN9Xph5Isf3ItF-N6TCjJN4H0QfKbc21qWf-QDMs?size_mode=3&amp;size=2048x1536\" width=\"523\" height=\"294\" /></p>\n\n<p>Another thing to do is to work out in groups. If you can find some friends and ya'll can go out and train together. We actually do <strong>FREE</strong> boot camps in New York every summer. I've been doing it for the past two years and they've been a lot of fun and they're coming back soon so go to <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" data-referer-safe=\"1\" data-referer-original-href=\"http://brandoncarter.com\">Brandoncarter.com</a> and signup for my mailing list so you don't miss out on that. We already got the permits to do it in <em><strong>Central Park</strong></em>. We might be doing it in some other cities. But even if you can't come to one of our events, start your own events, get a bunch of your friends together and be like<em><strong> \"Hey man, we're working out, we're going to the park\"</strong></em> That's what a lot of the street work out guys do. They all work out together.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\"> <br />\n</i></p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://photos-1.dropbox.com/t/2/AAACqMCZ35OzKhZNVnNUdpg1mb5X1G9m8ddgts9_mGJURA/12/479780791/jpeg/256x256/1/_/1/2/DSC08889.JPG/EI6p3fEDGNObAiAHKAc/kPlnIdMwm9a1I3JnoNfb-tF3xW4bYQDQlcPTNVK1y78?size_mode=3&amp;size=2048x1536\" width=\"567\" height=\"319\" /></p>\n\n<p>Finally man, if you really just hate it, find a way you can get into a sport. Play soccer, or football, or basketball, it's all a ton of cardio, find something. It doesn't have to be boring, when you think cardio you think of the elliptical machine, it doesn't have to be like that. I've been trying to learn how to kick box, and I suck.

There's really only two ways to do this. One, you can be just a total <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">newb, like if it's you first few months working out or like first year training, then maybe you can do it because your body is not used to it and it's in shock and it'll be acclimated to the new circumstances so it might put on some muscle while you're cutting. But if you've been training for any respectable amount of time, it's not really an option for you.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://accompliceaccessories.com.au/slir/w600/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/weak-guy-flexing.jpg\" width=\"296\" height=\"243\" />\n\nThe other way you can do it is by taking drugs. Steroids give you that extra testosterone that will help burn the fat and build muscle. But if you're a natural and you've been training for any respectable amount of time it's not going to happen. No matter what these motherfuckers tell you man.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\nLet me explain, to burn fat you need to be in a caloric deficit, meaning you're burning more calories than you consume. That's pretty much not debatable. To build muscle, you have to be in a caloric surplus. Some people say, <em><strong>\"You just need enough protein.\"</strong></em> I'm not saying that they're full of shit, I'm just saying that I've been a personal trainer, training people for over 15 years. While most of you guys were shitting on yourself's, I was in the gym training 10 people a day. I've been doing this for a long amount of time and I've never seen it happen with anyone who wasn't a total newb or a drug addict. I've never even heard someone say that their friend has done it. So, what do you do? I'll show you what I do.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.iron-body.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/steroids-640x300.jpg\" width=\"459\" height=\"215\" />\n\nI do a strategy called <em><strong>Micro Cutting</strong></em> and <strong><em>Micro Bulking</em></strong>. First of all, I suggest that you get as lean as you want to be. You want to have a visible six pack, be pretty lean, pretty cut. Then bulk. Bodybuilders bulk for months and then they get all fat. I don't want you to get all fat, I want you to bulk until your abs start fading away, then go do a cut and get your abs back. So it's like 2-4 weeks of cutting, 2-4 weeks of bulking, and it's going to be circumstantial depending on the person. It might be longer, it might be shorter.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\nYou can't do it at the same time. You can't build muscle and burn fat at the same time, but you can do it in the same month. You can cut for half a month and bulk for half the month. Now you're <strong>not</strong> going to build as much as if you went on a full on bulk for 6 months to a year. But that's not the goal, the goal is not to put on as much weight as possible, it's to put on as much lean muscle as possible and then cut off the fat and keep going back and fourth. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I'm almost always in a state of cutting or bulking.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://photos-4.dropbox.com/t/2/AAAc4kV2qM5JWFO4cvhlNHwcSEe3bE4aq8T1xwbhKsHs4Q/12/479780791/jpeg/256x256/1/_/1/2/IMG_4541.JPG/EI6p3fEDGNObAiAHKAc/eA_t8JauWJYjAR0KLjkzfz9lHOkW2ukz4F71t_7OEoc%2CVLhYrT8ENkOK-aijF9-0f4mn84kSTBHuYUY7UGgazWU?size_mode=3&amp;size=2048x1536\" width=\"431\" height=\"287\" />\n\nEven if you could hit this magical amount of protein that allows you to build muscle and burn fat at the same time, even if it were possible, it's not optimal. You're definitely not going to put on more muscle if you're not in a surplus and you're not going to lose one ounce of fat if you're not in a deficit.<span class=\"para_break\"><i class=\"copy_only\">\n</i>\n\nBut that's just my take on it. It's just what I've seen. This is not shit I'm making up, I tell you shit that I've seen work in the field, I've trained 1000's of motherfuckers. I've done this at a high level for the majority of my fucking life.

If you're not doing Bicep curls with the proper form, then you're NOT WORKING YOUR BICEPS! In this video I demonstrate exactly how to do a proper biceps curls so you will <em>get results faster</em>.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LsSLkDhu0A\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nWith every exercise if you are focusing on just one muscle group, you have to actually focus on that muscle group. I don't really work on single muscle groups myself. I'm a much bigger fan of all over exercises or combo exercises.\n<h3>The Perfect Bicep Curl</h3>\nThe bicep muscle does one thing, it pulls your forearm toward your shoulder. That's it. It pulls. So truly you don't have to figure out how to get biceps. You have them.\n\nYou have to grow them.\n\nIf you lift your forearm from the elbow, wrist facing up and then curl your arm up to your shoulder, the bicep will have done this work by contracting. When you lower the forearm the bicep contraction releases.\n\nIf you want to exercise only the bicep then only one thing can move on your entire body: the elbow joint. If anything else moves on your body you are reducing the amount of work the bicep has to do. Moving your entire body is not how to get biceps.\n\nIf your shoulder joint moves then the delts and even traps might be involved. If you curl your wrist then your forearm muscles will be helping. If you bed backwards at all then your back and core muscles will be helping. If you use your pelvis to help get the exercise moving then your core will be helping.\n\nYou must stand solidly and only move the elbow joint to do a perfect bicep curl.\n<h3>Don't stop at the Bicep</h3>\nThe bicep is truly only a portion of the upper arm muscle. When you isolate a muscle like the biceps you are at the same time ignoring a muscle, in this case the triceps.\n\nThe tricep muscle is the back of the arm. While biceps pull up, triceps push down. The two of them together form the upper arm. To have a really strong, defined arm we want to focus on both the tricep and bicep muscle equally. Since the muscles connect to tendons and bones, we want them to be equally powerful.\n\nSo work on the bicep, make it awesome. But then work on the tricep and make it awesome too.\n<h3>What Do We Do Next?</h3>\nCheck out my program<a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\"> The Simple Shredded Solution</a> for more information about burning fat and building muscles!\n\n&nbsp;","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Readers are always asking how to get biceps.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I see people doing bicep curls wrongly and they wonder why there arms don't get bigger or more ripped.

When you lower the forearm the bicep contraction releases.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to exercise only the bicep then only one thing can move on your entire body: the elbow joint. If anything else moves on your body you are reducing the amount of work the bicep has to do. Moving your entire body is not how to get biceps.</p>\n\n<p>If your shoulder joint moves then the delts and even traps might be involved. If you curl your wrist then your forearm muscles will be helping. If you bed backwards at all then your back and core muscles will be helping. If you use your pelvis to help get the exercise moving then your core will be helping.</p>\n\n<p>You must stand solidly and only move the elbow joint to do a perfect bicep curl.  </p>\n\n<h3>Don't stop at the Bicep</h3>  \n\n<p>The bicep is truly only a portion of the upper arm muscle. When you isolate a muscle like the biceps you are at the same time ignoring a muscle, in this case the triceps.</p>\n\n<p>The tricep muscle is the back of the arm. While biceps pull up, triceps push down. The two of them together form the upper arm. To have a really strong, defined arm we want to focus on both the tricep and bicep muscle equally. Since the muscles connect to tendons and bones, we want them to be equally powerful.</p>\n\n<p>So work on the bicep, make it awesome. But then work on the tricep and make it awesome too.  </p>\n\n<h3>What Do We Do Next?</h3>  \n\n<p>Check out my program<a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\"> The Simple Shredded Solution</a> for more information about burning fat and building muscles!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-11-12 03:47:18","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2010-11-12 03:47:18","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-11-12 03:47:18","published_by":1},{"id":2093,"uuid":"a214ae7a-c74d-4c42-89a9-f3ba2dd2273c","title":"How To Eat Like a pig and Still stay in shape during the Holidays","slug":"how-to-eat-like-a-pig-and-still-stay-in-shape-during-the-holidays","markdown":"If your like me, you ate WAY to much food on Thanksgiving!

Power Clean and Press","slug":"the-no-1-fat-burning-muscle-building-exercise-power-clean-and-press","markdown":"The \"Power Clean and Press\" is the movement that burns a fat, builds muscle wile increasing  strength and speed. Although this exercise targets primarily the front deltoids, it also works the trapezius, the quadriceps, the hamstrings, the gluts, and the triceps.\n\nHow To Do It:\n\nPlace an Olympic barbell on the floor and make sure that there is plenty of room on either side of the bar. Load the bar with the appropriate poundage, place your feet approximately shoulder width apart, and make sure that the bar is over the tops of your feet at the midpoint (halfway between your toes and your heel).\n\nFrom this position, bend down and grasp the bar with an overhand grip. Making sure that your knee's do not shoot out over your toe's, lower your buttocks to the floor until your thighs are parallel to the floor. It is of extreme importance that your lower back does not become arched during any point of this movement. If, during this movement, your lower back becomes arched, you dramatically increase the chances of sustaining a career ending lower back injury.\n\nUsing perfect form for this exercise should be your primary concern. It is of little value, and is even less impressive, to use too much weight while employing sloppy form.\n\nAfter you have followed the above instructions and are ready to perform the movement, contract your shoulder blades, look straight ahead and explode upward from the bottom of the movement. Using a quick movement, snap the weight up to chest level and then, using your shoulders, triceps and trapezius, push the weight toward the ceiling in a straight line. Then, under control, lower the weight back down to its original position on the floor. If you find yourself leaning too far backwards, use less poundage until you're able to perform the movement with perfect form.\n\nPick a heavy weight, preform the lift as many times as you can, rest 60-90 seconds, then repeat 3-5 times!\n\n\"But , how many reps should I do???\" I don't believe in trying to accomplish some arbitrary number of reps. Your set is not done until you CAN NOT DO ANY MORE!!! Don't even count the reps, just do as many as you can! Only count the sets and seconds between your sets every time you workout.

Load the bar with the appropriate poundage, place your feet approximately shoulder width apart, and make sure that the bar is over the tops of your feet at the midpoint (halfway between your toes and your heel).</p>\n\n<p>From this position, bend down and grasp the bar with an overhand grip. Making sure that your knee's do not shoot out over your toe's, lower your buttocks to the floor until your thighs are parallel to the floor. It is of extreme importance that your lower back does not become arched during any point of this movement. If, during this movement, your lower back becomes arched, you dramatically increase the chances of sustaining a career ending lower back injury.</p>\n\n<p>Using perfect form for this exercise should be your primary concern. It is of little value, and is even less impressive, to use too much weight while employing sloppy form.</p>\n\n<p>After you have followed the above instructions and are ready to perform the movement, contract your shoulder blades, look straight ahead and explode upward from the bottom of the movement. Using a quick movement, snap the weight up to chest level and then, using your shoulders, triceps and trapezius, push the weight toward the ceiling in a straight line. Then, under control, lower the weight back down to its original position on the floor. If you find yourself leaning too far backwards, use less poundage until you're able to perform the movement with perfect form.</p>\n\n<p>Pick a heavy weight, preform the lift as many times as you can, rest 60-90 seconds, then repeat 3-5 times!</p>\n\n<p>\"But , how many reps should I do???\" I don't believe in trying to accomplish some arbitrary number of reps. Your set is not done until you CAN NOT DO ANY MORE!!! Don't even count the reps, just do as many as you can! Only count the sets and seconds between your sets every time you workout. Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>Now, move on to your <a href=\"http://brandongcarter.com/category/fitness-blog\">arms, back and legs. </a>\"</p>","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2011-01-12 10:11:43","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2011-01-12 10:11:43","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2011-01-12 10:11:43","published_by":1},{"id":2096,"uuid":"e97740fb-fd9e-4136-966a-03d47bb2480e","title":"The Best Way to Combine Exercises to Lose Body Fat","slug":"exercises-to-lose-body-fat","markdown":"<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GZPb1bF5gk\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nYou can't get a six pack by crunches alone. You've got to combine exercises to lose body fat while you're training.\n\nYou can have the greatest, most muscular set of abs in the world, but if they are blanketed by a layer of body fat, who cares. In order to rid yourself of the extra body fat around your midsection, you need to incorporate effective cardio sessions into your fitness plan.\n\nYou cannot spot-reduce the midsection by doing extra ab exercises like crunches or sit-ups. You first must burn off the body fat through proper cardio to properly define the area.\n\nAbdominal training by itself will not do much. Cardio needs to be intense enough to do the trick. Three to four sessions a week of intense jogging, running, the Stairmaster, the elliptical, jumping rope, or biking should be enough to get the process in gear. Swimming, hiking, and taking aerobics classes are beneficial as well.\n\nThe more you can vary your exercises to lose body fat, the faster it will go. Plateaus will be broken.\n\nNothing beats jogging or running. It is the most intense, efficient, and effective method of burning calories. If running outside hurts your joints, try running inside on a treadmill or outside on a dirt path. It definitely is easier on the body. I do HIIT cardio like in the video below\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLdsR0uFKJ4\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nAgain, you NEED three to four intense cardio sessions a week to help create a calorie deficit and help rid the body of the fat that covers your abs.\n\nProper Nutrition:\n\nDo not sabotage your results in the gym by giving yourself a passport to pig out. Ridding the body of fat once and for all is accomplished by proper nutrition more so than incorporating cardio. At the end of the day, if you have consumed more calories than you have expended, you add body fat. So you need to burn more calories than you consume.\n\nYou've got to start thinking of nutrition as an exercise, just like abs. That exercise needs to be worked hard. If you then combine the exercises to lose body fat . . .then we'll get somewhere.\n\nNutrition is important because you can reduce the amount of calories you take in, therefore greatly having an effect on the amount which you have to expend through cardio. Eat five to six small, well-balanced meals spaced apart about every three to four hours. Try to keep something healthy on hand.\n\nIf not, when you become real hungry, you will opt for something that isn't as good for you. When you become overly hungry, all rational thinking goes out the window.\n\nBut it is important to get something in you. Not eating on time or at all is almost as bad as eating too much. Keep protein intake high (approximately 50% of daily calories), carbs moderate (40%), and fats minimal (10%).\n\nMuscle fiber is made of tightly-wound protein molecules that is damaged during a workout, so you need more protein than the sedentary person to help that muscle tissue repair. Carbohydrates have an important role in the body, but do not base your meals on them. Try to avoid simple sugars like cane sugar, honey, fruit juices, syrups, and even a lot of fruit.\n\nDrink at least a gallon of clean water each day as well. It will help in nutrient absorption and digestion and will help flush toxins from the body.\n\nBottom line, make sure you are supplying your body with well-balanced, healthy food every three to four hours. Consider nutrition an exercise, the combine all your exercises to <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/category/fat-loss\">lose body fat fast</a>.\n\nWeight training The Abdominals:\n\nHere is where most people go wrong in their attempt to develop their abs. I often ask those I train, \"Would you train your biceps with sets of 50 reps with no weight?\" Of course, they say \"no.\" How about your chest, 50 reps with no weight? Another no. I then ask, \"Then why would you do that with your abs?\"\n\nHere's an important key. If you want proper ab development, you need to add resistance (weight) to your ab exercises. Abs are muscles just like biceps, triceps, pecs, glutes, whatever. You need resistance to properly strengthen and build them. The same goes for abdominals\n\nIf your abs are strong, your still going to have to have low body fat for your six pack to show! Make sure you follow a good diet (like the one in my workout plan). I will also help  to try a good fat burner like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme\">TEA REXX</a>, it is what I use to help me stay ripped.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GZPb1bF5gk\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<p>You can't get a six pack by crunches alone.

High rep snatches work more muscle groups than sprinting and will build strength in the lower back, shoulders, and hip flexors. Its kind of fun too!\n\nYou can literally work every muscle in your body with the kettlebell. Weight Loss begins when you're body is expending more calories than it is taking in, so the kettlebell is a perfect tool.

Similar to the way the body burns fat during ketogenesis, the Human body burns more fat when its exposed to cold temperatures because our bodies must generate internal heat to maintain a constant 98.6 degree temperature. To do this the body will convert available and stored energy  (BODY FAT) into body heat.\n\nTo take advantage of this I tried to start taking ice baths.... But I found out that I could not handle that shit at all! I have found that working out in the cold works a lot better for me\n\nI go out in the cold with not much clothing on and I do the following workout:do 3 sets per exercise. Do each exercise for 30 seconds rest 30 seconds between sets\n\n1. jumping jacks\n\n2. Jumping Lunges\n\n3. Jumping High Knees\nI am sure that any form of HIIT cardio will work.\n\n<strong>5 Reasons Why Cold Exposure is Healthy</strong>\n1. Cold Thermogenesis makes your body release fatty acids to fuel your shivering.\n\n2. Cold exposure increases adiponectin, a hormone secreted by fat cells and responsible for fat burning, and glucose uptake by muscle that may last long after you warm up.\n\n3. Cold exposure stimulates brown fat, the “fat burning fat” to increase in quantity and activity.\n\n4. Cold exposure improves immunity.\n\n5. Cold exposure may be an effective treatment for depression.\n\n<strong>5 Ways To Use Cold Exposure To Lose Fat..</strong>\n\n1. Lay on your back on the couch with an ice pack under your lower neck and upper back for 20-30 minutes, preferably in the evening.\n\n2. Drink 500 ml of ice cold water immediately upon waking. I wrote about this yesterday when I discussed 3 healthy eating habits.\n\n3. Take 5-10 minute cold showers, focusing the water on your lower neck and upper back. Best times for a cold shower is before breakfast or before bed.\n\n4. Take 20 minute ice baths that induce shivering.\n\n5. Do some of your exercise in a pool! Swim laps, take an aqua jogging class, or even aqua aerobics!\n\n6. Go for shiver walks. That is, go for a walk with the most amount of clothes on that will make you shiver slightly.\n\nWe don't want to rely solely on cold thermogenesis for fat loss though.

As an added bonus, compound exercises help develop the body proportionately.\n\nCompound exercises are movements that use multiple joints at one time. When you perform compound exercises, more muscle groups are recruited and used per exercise. For example, POWER CLEAN AND PRESS is a multi-joint exercise because the shoulder and elbow, nee, and hip joints are working to execute the movement. In turn, the POWER CLEAN AND PRESS works several muscle groups, including the muscles in the, legs, cavs, glutes, chest, shoulders, and triceps.\n\nOn the other hand, the biceps curl is a single-joint exercise since only the elbow joint is moving. The biceps curl only works the biceps muscle and is more of an isolated exercise.\n\nSo, when you are looking for a quality workout that hits lots of muscles, compound exercises help you do more in less time. By working several muscle groups at the same time, you can perform fewer exercises and reduce the total amount of time you spend in the gym.\n\nCompound exercises also increase strength and size far more effectively than single-joint, isolation exercises. This doesn't mean that single-joint exercises are ineffective. Exercises that isolate certain muscles and muscle groups do have an important role in fitness, especially for advanced lifters. However, if your schedule calls for reduced exercise time, compound exercises are the way to go. As an added bonus, they are more functional since virtually every movement in everyday activities, such as sitting or kneeling, and in sports like basketball or baseball, involve moving multiple joints.\n\n<strong>Multi-Joint Exercises</strong>\nSquats: Recognized mostly for building powerful thighs and hips, squats also add size to the upper body -- including the back, shoulders, chest, and arms -- due to their anabolic effect.\n\nDeadlifts: The deadlift is another anabolic king because it not only increases lower body growth, but that of the upper body as well.\n\n<strong>Leg Presses:</strong> These enable you to use heavier resistance than do leg extensions or curls, thus promoting more muscle growth. While three or more sets each of leg extensions and leg curls mainly work the quadriceps and hamstrings respectively, three or more heavy sets of leg presses or squats will strengthen and add more mass to the quadriceps, hamstrings and gluteals -- in a shorter time frame!\n\nFront, Side or Reverse Lunges and Stepups: These are also excellent time-saving multi-joint lower body exercises, and they are particularly more functional for sports and daily activities than leg extensions or leg curls.\n\n<strong>Bench Presses, Dips and Pushups:</strong> When it comes to the upper body, bench presses, dips and pushups not only add mass to the chest, shoulders and back, but the triceps as well. In fact, they do it much more effectively than single-joint tricep pressdowns or kickbacks. Also, eliminate those single-joint dumbbell flyes for the chest for several weeks; these exercises will build up your chest muscles to a greater degree in less time.\n\n<strong>Overhead Presses:</strong> Excellent for shoulders and triceps.\n\n<strong>Pulldowns, Pullups, Barbell Rows, and Dumbbell Rows:</strong> You'll see your biceps grow without doing one curl; not to mention the added size of your back muscles from doing these exercises.\n\n<strong>Upright Rows:</strong> They're also a bicep and forearm-building movement, as well as a wonderful shoulder and upper back exercise.\n\n<a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">For more all over fitness tips visit The Simple Shredded Solution</a>\"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Exercises can be classified either as compound, which are exercises that involve more than one muscle group, or isolation exercises, which are exercises that isolate a muscle group by concentrating on that one group of muscles.For the most time-efficient workouts, compound exercises are recommended because compound exercises can stimulate all the major muscles in the body and create the greatest change in body composition in the shortest time.

Every time you put a new stress load on your body, your muscles get slightly damaged. Then, during the rest time after your workout, they rebuild and become even stronger, so they will be better equipped to handle that particular stress should it be encountered again.\n\nWhen you perform the same routine day in and day out, your body gets used to the stress and no longer sees a reason to adapt and grow any stronger. This is when you stop noticing changes in your strength, quickness and size.\n\nTo overcome this problem, you need to constantly find new ways to shock your system and send it into a state of repair. A great way to do that is with supersets.\nwhat are supersets?\nSupersets are essentially two exercises performed back to back that target opposing muscle groups, namely one agonist and one antagonist muscle group. Examples of such muscles are the biceps and triceps, hamstrings and quads, and chest and back.\n\nThey are also different from normal sets as you don't rest between exercises, whereas you would normally take around 90 seconds rest between sets.\n\nwhy should you do them?\nSupersets are a great technique for plateau busting and for sparking your motivation to keep training. Often, when you force yourself to perform the same workouts over and over, you no longer have the burning desire to make it to every planned workout session. By changing your routine, you will find yourself excited again and actually looking forward to pushing your body past its limits.\n\nSupersets are also a great technique for increasing muscle size, as they boost the release of anabolic hormones like testosterone, which is responsible for muscle growth. In addition, you will reduce the amount of time you spend in the gym, as you will be working two muscle groups within the same set.\n\nAnother great benefit for those who train at home or on the road is that you don't need really heavy weights; you can push your muscles to their limits with lighter weights, which means that you can still have a great workout with minimal equipment.\n\nHowever, supersets aren't the best technique if you are exclusively looking to increase your strength. The reasoning behind this is simple: Since it is a higher-intensity workout, you will not be able to lift as much weight as you would if you were doing regular sets with longer rest periods, translating into a lesser pure strength gain.\n\nAlso, when performing supersets, it's a good idea to focus only on two opposing muscle groups, while maintaining your normal workout for the rest of your body. This will allow you to hit those particular muscles harder without over stressing all your muscles.\n\nA good approach is to focus on a given muscle group for a period of 2 to 4 weeks before switching to a new group. After you've hit all the muscles you would like to with this technique, take a few weeks off and return to a straight set workout plan for another 2 to 4 weeks. This will allow all your muscles to fully recover from the supersets before you hit them again, working them into your routine as you did when you started.\n\nDuring the workout itself, perform your 2 exercises back to back with no rest period, and after the whole set is completed, take a 60- to 90-second rest period.\n\nStart off performing 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps for each exercise, and 2 different exercises for each muscle. As you advance, you can increase your sets to 3 to 4 total, and start performing 3 different exercises per muscle.\n\nNote: this dose not really work well with abs. For abs, Make sure you try out my new 6 pack / Fat burning workout too!\n\nLET NOTHING STOP YOU!!!\n\n.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>One of the biggest reasons you reach a plateau in your workout is that you are doing the same thing over and over again.

This will allow all your muscles to fully recover from the supersets before you hit them again, working them into your routine as you did when you started.</p>\n\n<p>During the workout itself, perform your 2 exercises back to back with no rest period, and after the whole set is completed, take a 60- to 90-second rest period.</p>\n\n<p>Start off performing 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps for each exercise, and 2 different exercises for each muscle. As you advance, you can increase your sets to 3 to 4 total, and start performing 3 different exercises per muscle.</p>\n\n<p>Note: this dose not really work well with abs.

They lose both fat and muscle during starvation dieting, so when the starvation dieting ends (because it's not sustainable) people return to their old eating habits, but this time they have less muscle mass, so their metabolism is lower.

If you desire for rock hard abs, then add weights to your midsection exercises.\n\nDoing weighted ab workouts is a great alternative to the old standby of performing a thousand sit-ups with nothing more than body weight resistance. While many people may assume that weighted ab training is nothing more than slapping a dumbbell across your chest while grinding out endless sit-ups and crunches, there are many more effective exercises.\n<h3>Why Add Resistance?</h3>\nThe primary reason for adding resistance to your standard ab routine is the same reason you add resistance to any other muscle group on the body -- to increase the challenge and force adaptations through progressive overload. The abs are a muscle group like any other, and the best way to gain in strength and muscle tone is to add resistance.\n\nDo not go on your merry way and ignore this six pack training secret. Take action. Do it!\n<h3>Traditional Weighted Exercises</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/04102541/IMG_1557.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1615\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/04102541/IMG_1557-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1557\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>By using a weight plate, dumbbell, or medicine ball, many exercises can be made more challenging and effective. This works best with ab exercises like sit-ups, crunches, decline sit-ups, and straight-leg sit-ups. It can, however, also work for exercises like knee and leg raises by either adding ankle weights or holding a medicine ball between the feet.\n\nWhen adding weights for your six pack training, aim for fewer target reps. Six to 12 reps per set will keep you in the hypertrophy zone for quality muscle development. Choose a weight that is challenging but still allows you to work through a full range of motion for all of your desired repetitions. Aim to increase repetitions or weight each week to ensure continued progress.\n<h3>Sample Weighted Ab Workout</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Ab crunch machine</strong></td>\n<td width=\"340\">3 sets, 6-8 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Weighted sit-ups</strong></td>\n<td width=\"340\">2 sets, 8-10 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Weighted leg raises</strong></td>\n<td width=\"340\">3 sets, 6-8 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Cable pull-down crunch</strong></td>\n<td width=\"340\">2 sets, 8-10 reps</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThe chart includes a total of 10 sets.

If you desire for rock hard abs, then add weights to your midsection exercises.</p>\n\n<p>Doing weighted ab workouts is a great alternative to the old standby of performing a thousand sit-ups with nothing more than body weight resistance. While many people may assume that weighted ab training is nothing more than slapping a dumbbell across your chest while grinding out endless sit-ups and crunches, there are many more effective exercises.  </p>\n\n<h3>Why Add Resistance?</h3>  \n\n<p>The primary reason for adding resistance to your standard ab routine is the same reason you add resistance to any other muscle group on the body -- to increase the challenge and force adaptations through progressive overload. The abs are a muscle group like any other, and the best way to gain in strength and muscle tone is to add resistance.</p>\n\n<p>Do not go on your merry way and ignore this six pack training secret. Take action. Do it!  </p>\n\n<h3>Traditional Weighted Exercises</h3>  \n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/04102541/IMG_1557.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1615\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/04102541/IMG_1557-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1557\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>By using a weight plate, dumbbell, or medicine ball, many exercises can be made more challenging and effective. This works best with ab exercises like sit-ups, crunches, decline sit-ups, and straight-leg sit-ups. It can, however, also work for exercises like knee and leg raises by either adding ankle weights or holding a medicine ball between the feet.</p>\n\n<p>When adding weights for your six pack training, aim for fewer target reps. Six to 12 reps per set will keep you in the hypertrophy zone for quality muscle development. Choose a weight that is challenging but still allows you to work through a full range of motion for all of your desired repetitions. Aim to increase repetitions or weight each week to ensure continued progress.  </p>\n\n<h3>Sample Weighted Ab Workout</h3>  \n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Ab crunch machine</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"340\">3 sets, 6-8 reps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Weighted sit-ups</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"340\">2 sets, 8-10 reps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Weighted leg raises</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"340\">3 sets, 6-8 reps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Cable pull-down crunch</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"340\">2 sets, 8-10 reps</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<p>The chart includes a total of 10 sets.

Without these foundational pillars, it's all too easy to veer off track.\nWithout further ado, here are the 5 components of physical fitness to help you accomplish your fitness goals this year.\n<h3><strong>1. Make Exercise Part of Your Daily Routine  </strong></h3>\nExercise should be a regular part of your day, not something sporadic. Just as you set aside time for meals, sleep, school and/or work, set aside time for exercise. Pencil it in on your calendar, program it into your smartphone, and stick to it just like you would any other important appointment. For best results, you may find that exercising at the same time and on the same days each week (such as first thing in the morning every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday) helps you stay on track.\n<h3><strong>2. Pick a SPECIFIC goal</strong></h3>\nGoals that can’t be measured can’t be attained.</p><p>You need to be able to determine whether you’ve reached your goals or not.</p><p>For instance, a goal like “get in better shape” is not easily measured, but a goal  like “have a 32-inch waist by July 4th,” is.</p><p>Don’t start your resolutions until you have a measurable goal, or else you will almost certainly fail.\n<h3><strong>3. Measure Measure Measure</strong> (!!!But Never With a Scale!!!!)</h3>\nYou must measure your progress because when you see that you have progressed, you’ll be motivated to keep going.</p><p>If your goal is to lose weight or gain muscle mass, I STRONGLY suggest that you stay off the scale. Scales are grossly misleading. if you're trying to lose weight, you may be losing A LOT of FAT, but you can still end up weighing the same (or MORE) because you have gained muscle!\n\nThe same goes for people trying to put on muscle. The scale may tell you that you're not gaining, or that you're gaining really slowly, even though you're probably gaining a lot more muscle than you think. Your weight may be staying the same because your workouts are burning off excess body fat.\n\nThe best way to measure your progress is with a tape measure. I am going to go into more detail on this subject in upcoming posts, but for now, just know that measuring inches you lose on your waist is the best way to tell if you're losing fat. If you're trying to gain muscle mass, it's best to measure your arms, shoulders, chest, and legs to see how much you have gained.</p><p>I suggest you take your measurements once a week and make sure you keep records of your progress.\n<h3>4. Plan Your Work and Work Your Plan</h3>\nA goal without a plan is just another one of your bullshit ideas that will never come into fruition. You NEED to know the time you're going to work out every day, and you need to know EXACTLY what you're going to do. If you're not following a detailed workout routine, then you're just wasting your time.\n\nyou do NOT want to be one of those guys aimlessly wandering around the gym, not knowing what to do, Or even worse, you don't want to be in there talking to people like the gym is the happy hour spot. If you're going to do that, you should just stay at home and pretend to work out there.\n\nIf you are serious about fitness and your health, then you need to be razor focused come workout time. Whether  you're working out in a gym or at home (like me), you need to be focused. When I am working out, I know exactly what I am going to do and how long it's going to take.\n<h3>5. Take Action</h3>\n“I’ll start tomorrow.” “I’ll start next week.” No way; start right now. Don’t wait because we all know that tomorrow never comes. What steps can you take right now to get you closer to achieving your goal?\n<h3>What Kind of Results Can You Expect from Hard Work?</h3>\nBefore I go into detail about these five components, though, I would like to show you a quick inspirational reminder of what's possible when you make a commitment and stick to it.\n\nA few weeks ago, I reserved some before and after pics from someone that got into shape using my workouts. The email he sent me was titled <em>“Using You as an Inspiration, I've Got These Results.</em>” Here are his before and after pics:\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-607\" title=\"results\" src=\"http://highlifeworkout.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/results.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"187\" />\n\nThe pics were emailed to me from Anders Christensen, you can contact him on <a href=\"http://on.fb.me/rK8r4x\" target=\"_blank\">his Facebook</a> if you have any questions about how he got into better shape.\n\nI love <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/category/Before-and-after\" target=\"_blank\">hearing about the great results </a>people have been getting from following my regimen. I want even more of you to reach your goals in 2012, and I know that a lot of you have made New Year's resolutions to do just that. Unfortunately for many, surveys suggest that up to 88% of people who make a New Year’s resolution fail.\n<h3>What do I do next?</h3>\nFor best results, make sure you follow a good total body routine and diet. It may also help to try a good fat burner like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme\">TEA REXX</a>. It is what I use to help stay ripped.

Now, I realize that many people will say six meals is absolutely absurd, so the thing I want to stress is that they don’t have to be sit-down meals at all. For example, take a grilled chicken breast with a baked potato on the side, and you have an excellent small meal with a good protein-carbohydrate ratio. Another great substitute would be a meal replacement of whey protein powder if you don't have the time to make food.\n\nLet me take you through the list of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2674713\" target=\"_blank\">benefits of having six meals a day</a> as opposed to three:\n\n<strong>Boost in Metabolism - </strong>six meals a day has actually been proven to increase metabolism for several reasons. The main factor is the thermic effect of food, which is the calories it takes your body to break down and absorb the food. Foods have a thermic effect range from 3-30%, and foods like protein are way up in that 30 percentile followed by carbohydrates in the 20% range. Burning calories just by eating more frequently? Sounds like a great deal to me!\n\n<strong>Increase in Energy - </strong>Eating six meals a day helps maintain a balanced blood sugar level in the body, which prevents hunger attacks and will give you an incredible surge of energy while going through the long work day.\n\n<strong>Lean Muscle Gains - </strong>Lastly and most important, six meals a day will drastically help you build and maintain muscle. The greater number of meals gives the muscles a constant supply of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein.\n\n<strong>Putting it all Together</strong> - The key is to prepare as much as possible the night before. Do all the cooking and preparation beforehand so you can incorporate six meals into your busy work schedule.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVUuxFDGEtQ\n<h3>What about Counting Calories?</h3>\nForget about counting calories! That's too difficult and unsustainable for the average person. I suggest that you go by portion size. we will say that \"portion\" is the size of your hand or fist. When you see \"protein, carb, vegetable, or fruit\" it means to eat at LEAST one portion of each.

Now, I realize that many people will say six meals is absolutely absurd, so the thing I want to stress is that they don’t have to be sit-down meals at all. For example, take a grilled chicken breast with a baked potato on the side, and you have an excellent small meal with a good protein-carbohydrate ratio. Another great substitute would be a meal replacement of whey protein powder if you don't have the time to make food.</p>\n\n<p>Let me take you through the list of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2674713\" target=\"_blank\">benefits of having six meals a day</a> as opposed to three:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Boost in Metabolism - </strong>six meals a day has actually been proven to increase metabolism for several reasons. The main factor is the thermic effect of food, which is the calories it takes your body to break down and absorb the food. Foods have a thermic effect range from 3-30%, and foods like protein are way up in that 30 percentile followed by carbohydrates in the 20% range. Burning calories just by eating more frequently? Sounds like a great deal to me!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Increase in Energy - </strong>Eating six meals a day helps maintain a balanced blood sugar level in the body, which prevents hunger attacks and will give you an incredible surge of energy while going through the long work day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lean Muscle Gains - </strong>Lastly and most important, six meals a day will drastically help you build and maintain muscle. The greater number of meals gives the muscles a constant supply of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Putting it all Together</strong> - The key is to prepare as much as possible the night before. Do all the cooking and preparation beforehand so you can incorporate six meals into your busy work schedule.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVUuxFDGEtQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVUuxFDGEtQ</a>  </p>\n\n<h3>What about Counting Calories?</h3>  \n\n<p>Forget about counting calories!

What you need to remember though, is that the protein and your body won't start repairing your muscle tissue until you are at rest for a extended period of time, such as sleep. What this means is that if you are lacking sleep, your body isn't getting sufficient time to repair and recover your muscles one hundred percent.\n\nIn addition to this, since sleep is the primary time the body recovers from exercise, it's also when you will be rebuilding your torn muscle tissues. Without this recovery time, you're going to go into your next exercise session at a disadvantage.\n\nFinally, you must not overlook the connection between the amount of sleep you get and your overall exercise performance. When you are short on sleep, it's quite typical to find yourself struggling to maintain the usual level of exercise that you normally would tolerate quite well.\n\nOne of the key recommendations for combating over training syndrome, which will quickly take you away from your workouts and limit further fat loss, is getting quality sleep. Failing to do so could mean you having to take time away from your program, which will without question of a doubt, slow you down.\n\nSo make sure you're getting your 7-8 hours of sleep each night.

Common answers may include bicep curls, preacher curls, or prison curls. These exercises are all fine and dandy. However, for an exercise that really targets the biceps like no other, give hammer curls a try.\n<h3>Why Hammer Curls?</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/22211823/IMG_20150821_180518.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1544\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/22211823/IMG_20150821_180518-300x205.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20150821_180518\" width=\"300\" height=\"205\" /></a>\n\nThe bicep is actually comprised of two separate muscles: the long-head and short-head biceps. The long-head is located in the outer edge of the upper arm, while the short-head is located in the inner part. Common isolation exercises like bicep curls tend to work more of the short-head with little of the long-head bicep being recruited. Hammer curls are one of the few isolation exercises that place more of the emphasis on the long-head. This is what makes it one of the best workouts for biceps.\n<h3>How to Do Hammer Curls</h3>\nHammer curls are performed with the weights held vertically. If using a barbell, then you will need a T-grip barbell. With this in mind, perform them the way you would perform a basic curl. This means adhering to good form with the upper arms firmly tucked into your ribs if using free weights.\n\nIncorporating hammer curls every other arm workout is a terrific way to target both the long-head and short-head biceps for maximum arm muscle gains.\n\nHere are a few sample hammer curl workouts:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Hammer curls on bicep curl machine (grab the vertical portion of the handles)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"340\">3 sets, 5-6 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Hammer curls on cable machine (using a tricep pull-down rope like the one pictured above)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"340\">3 sets, 5-6 reps</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Standing hammer barbell curls (using T-Grip barbell)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"340\">3 sets, 6-8 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Seated hammer prison curls</strong></td>\n<td width=\"340\">3 sets, 6-8 reps</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Preacher hammer curls</strong></td>\n<td width=\"340\">3 sets, 8-10 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"340\"><strong>Alternating dumbbell hammer curls</strong></td>\n<td width=\"340\">3 sets, 8-10 reps</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThese exercises should be done after your compound workout.

The long-head is located in the outer edge of the upper arm, while the short-head is located in the inner part. Common isolation exercises like bicep curls tend to work more of the short-head with little of the long-head bicep being recruited.

When you're working out you breaking down your body and telling it to get stronger, muscles grow while you are resting and sleeping. This is called \"Recovering\". If you dont let your muscles to recover, they will never grow!!!\n\nIt's called \"Overtraining\" and you NEED to avoid it like the plague!!!\n\nOvertraining occurs when you try train you workout the same body parts too often with out allowing them to recover between workouts. Without recovery, the body is repeatedly stressed to the point where rest is no longer adequate to allow for recovery. When this takes place for weeks or even months, this is called the \"overtraining syndrome\".\n\nThe overtraining syndrome is the name given to all of the symptoms that occur due to overtraining. These symptoms include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Pain in muscles &amp; joints</li>\n \t<li>Washed-out feeling, tired, drained, lack of energy, fatigue</li>\n \t<li>Headaches</li>\n \t<li>Inability to relax, twitchy, fidgety</li>\n \t<li>Unquenchable thirst, dehydration</li>\n \t<li>Lowered resistance to common illnesses; colds, sore throat, etc.</li>\n \t<li>Moody, irritable</li>\n \t<li>Altered sleep patterns</li>\n \t<li>Depression</li>\n \t<li>Loss of competitive desire</li>\n \t<li>Decreased appetite</li>\n \t<li>Weight loss</li>\n \t<li>Persistent muscle soreness</li>\n \t<li>Increased occurrence of injuries</li>\n</ul>\nAs you can see, overtraining is no joke! It has affected almost everyone who has stepped foot in a gym at one point or another. It should be taken into consideration when creating a workout plan of any sort.\n<strong> Why Does Overtraining Occur?</strong>\nMost of the time, overtraining occurs because people train or do the same activity targeting a muscle group that hasn't fully recovered. Other times, it's from the lack of nutrients and calories to rebuild what you body broke down through exercise.\n\nExample: Lets say that you worked out your back on Monday. Your biceps had a good workout from that and are still recovering when you work out your biceps on Tuesday. Since your biceps are still recovering and you worked them out anyways, this is putting your biceps in an overtrained state. Because this only happened this one time and the degree of overtraining isn't that great, a few days of rest would easily allow your body to bounce back and get out of the overtrained state.\n\nIf you don't allow for your arms to rest and continue breaking them down further while not giving them adequate time for rest and recovery, then the overtraining syndrome will occur. Once the overtraining syndrome occurs, you will experience symptoms and recovering from the overtraining syndrome will take longer. The amount of rest required to get out of the overtraining syndrome varies from person to person.\n\n<strong>Factors that influence this are:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>How efficient your body is at recovering</li>\n \t<li>The amount of food you are consuming for your body to use for repair and growth</li>\n \t<li>How much sleep you are giving your body.</li>\n</ul>\nWith all of these factors in place, you will recover from the overtraining syndrome more rapidly.\n\n<strong>How Do I Recover If I Am Overtrained?</strong>\nIf you are in an overtrained state and have overtraining syndrome, rest is key to recovering. Depending on how long your body was in an overtrained state, you might only need 3-5 days of rest without stressful activity. If you were in an overtrained state for much longer, you will have to increase your rest days accordingly. It is impossible to tell you exactly how long you need to rest due to the fact that everyone is different.\n\nA good diet that gives your body a surplus amount of calories and an adequate amount of sleep will increase your rate of recovery. Also, a multivitamin and lots of vitamin C will help your immune system to recover from the overtraining syndrome. I Strongly Recommend This Multivitamin. I tried if for the first time earlier this year, and now I take it everyday!\n\n.\n<strong>How Do You Prevent Overtraining?</strong>\nMaking a workout plan that will give you adequate rest to heal, repair, and grow can prevent overtraining. Take into consideration how many days a week you are working out and how many times a week you are hitting each muscle group. It is wise to rest at least one day a week, no matter how light your weight training may be. It is also recommended that you don't work each muscle group more than two days a week (unless you are doing a special program that calls for you to do so).\n\nAnother way to prevent overtraining is by making sure you are<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/how-sleep-helps-you-burn-fat-and-build-muscle-faster/\" target=\"_blank\"> getting enough sleep</a>. Bodybuilders everywhere swear by at least eight hours of sleep each night. For children, nine hours is recommended. Some Pro Bodybuilders sleep 13 hours each day while he prepared for contests!\n\nThe final, and probably the most important prevention method, is to make a<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/how-and-what-to-eat-too-lose-weight-and-gain-muscle/\" target=\"_blank\"> diet that will allow your body the nutrients it needs in order to meet the demands that exercise has placed on it</a>. Getting enough protein in your diet is the first place to start.\n\nAs for carbohydrates, make sure you are consuming enough so that your body is burning either fats or carbohydrates for an energy source and not protein or amino acids. With fats, at least consume enough for your body to carry on with its hormonal and bodily functions.\n\nCheck out the post below for more info on topics that will make sure your NEVER overtraing!\n\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/top-5-tips-to-help-you-reach-your-fitness-goals-in-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Top 5 Tips To Help You Reach Your Fitness Goals In 2012\"</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/how-and-what-to-eat-too-lose-weight-and-gain-muscle/\" target=\"_blank\">\"What To Eat Too Lose Weight and Gain Muscle\"</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/how-sleep-helps-you-burn-fat-and-build-muscle-faster/\" target=\"_blank\">\"How Sleep Helps You Burn Fat and Build Muscle Faster!\"</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/drink-more-water-to-burn-fat-build-muscle-faster/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Drink More Water To Burn Fat &amp; Build Muscle Faster\"</a>\n\n!!!

These symptoms include:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n     <li>Pain in muscles &amp; joints</li>\n     <li>Washed-out feeling, tired, drained, lack of energy, fatigue</li>\n     <li>Headaches</li>\n     <li>Inability to relax, twitchy, fidgety</li>\n     <li>Unquenchable thirst, dehydration</li>\n     <li>Lowered resistance to common illnesses; colds, sore throat, etc.</li>\n     <li>Moody, irritable</li>\n     <li>Altered sleep patterns</li>\n     <li>Depression</li>\n     <li>Loss of competitive desire</li>\n     <li>Decreased appetite</li>\n     <li>Weight loss</li>\n     <li>Persistent muscle soreness</li>\n     <li>Increased occurrence of injuries</li>\n</ul>  \n\n<p>As you can see, overtraining is no joke! It has affected almost everyone who has stepped foot in a gym at one point or another. It should be taken into consideration when creating a workout plan of any sort. <br />\n<strong> Why Does Overtraining Occur?</strong> <br />\nMost of the time, overtraining occurs because people train or do the same activity targeting a muscle group that hasn't fully recovered. Other times, it's from the lack of nutrients and calories to rebuild what you body broke down through exercise.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Lets say that you worked out your back on Monday. Your biceps had a good workout from that and are still recovering when you work out your biceps on Tuesday. Since your biceps are still recovering and you worked them out anyways, this is putting your biceps in an overtrained state. Because this only happened this one time and the degree of overtraining isn't that great, a few days of rest would easily allow your body to bounce back and get out of the overtrained state.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't allow for your arms to rest and continue breaking them down further while not giving them adequate time for rest and recovery, then the overtraining syndrome will occur. Once the overtraining syndrome occurs, you will experience symptoms and recovering from the overtraining syndrome will take longer. The amount of rest required to get out of the overtraining syndrome varies from person to person.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Factors that influence this are:</strong>  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n     <li>How efficient your body is at recovering</li>\n     <li>The amount of food you are consuming for your body to use for repair and growth</li>\n     <li>How much sleep you are giving your body.</li>\n</ul>  \n\n<p>With all of these factors in place, you will recover from the overtraining syndrome more rapidly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How Do I Recover If I Am Overtrained?</strong> <br />\nIf you are in an overtrained state and have overtraining syndrome, rest is key to recovering. Depending on how long your body was in an overtrained state, you might only need 3-5 days of rest without stressful activity. If you were in an overtrained state for much longer, you will have to increase your rest days accordingly. It is impossible to tell you exactly how long you need to rest due to the fact that everyone is different.</p>\n\n<p>A good diet that gives your body a surplus amount of calories and an adequate amount of sleep will increase your rate of recovery. Also, a multivitamin and lots of vitamin C will help your immune system to recover from the overtraining syndrome. I Strongly Recommend This Multivitamin. I tried if for the first time earlier this year, and now I take it everyday!</p>\n\n<p>.\n<strong>How Do You Prevent Overtraining?</strong> <br />\nMaking a workout plan that will give you adequate rest to heal, repair, and grow can prevent overtraining. Take into consideration how many days a week you are working out and how many times a week you are hitting each muscle group. It is wise to rest at least one day a week, no matter how light your weight training may be. It is also recommended that you don't work each muscle group more than two days a week (unless you are doing a special program that calls for you to do so).</p>\n\n<p>Another way to prevent overtraining is by making sure you are<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/how-sleep-helps-you-burn-fat-and-build-muscle-faster/\" target=\"_blank\"> getting enough sleep</a>. Bodybuilders everywhere swear by at least eight hours of sleep each night. For children, nine hours is recommended. Some Pro Bodybuilders sleep 13 hours each day while he prepared for contests!</p>\n\n<p>The final, and probably the most important prevention method, is to make a<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/how-and-what-to-eat-too-lose-weight-and-gain-muscle/\" target=\"_blank\"> diet that will allow your body the nutrients it needs in order to meet the demands that exercise has placed on it</a>. Getting enough protein in your diet is the first place to start.</p>\n\n<p>As for carbohydrates, make sure you are consuming enough so that your body is burning either fats or carbohydrates for an energy source and not protein or amino acids. With fats, at least consume enough for your body to carry on with its hormonal and bodily functions.</p>\n\n<p>Check out the post below for more info on topics that will make sure your NEVER overtraing!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/top-5-tips-to-help-you-reach-your-fitness-goals-in-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Top 5 Tips To Help You Reach Your Fitness Goals In 2012\"</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/how-and-what-to-eat-too-lose-weight-and-gain-muscle/\" target=\"_blank\">\"What To Eat Too Lose Weight and Gain Muscle\"</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/how-sleep-helps-you-burn-fat-and-build-muscle-faster/\" target=\"_blank\">\"How Sleep Helps You Burn Fat and Build Muscle Faster!\"</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/drink-more-water-to-burn-fat-build-muscle-faster/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Drink More Water To Burn Fat &amp; Build Muscle Faster\"</a></p>\n\n<p>!!!

It's really a matter of putting the ideas into practice and being consistent. Want to know how you can start melting off the inches in no time? Follow these top five tips to lose fat the easy way.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1. Eliminate Junk Food (Most of the Time)</strong></h3>\nYou may think this is a no-brainer, but you'll be surprised at how those few chips, sodas, and cookies on a regular basis add up (we just saw a cookie package, and each cookie, about two bites, packed 125 calories! Eat 8 and that's about half your daily calorie intake at 1,000 calories).\n\nNotice that we said to eliminate junk food \"most of the time.\" That's because allowing it once or twice a week will prevent over-the-top binges. Besides, a loose-eating day with a higher-calorie jolt prevents your metabolism from slowing down, so it's a good thing.\n\nI take one \"CHEAT DAY\" a week; on that day, I eat ANYTHING I WANT!!!\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>2. Tone Down Alcohol Consumption</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A few beers or libations every so often won't hurt, but if you do it regularly, you hamper your body's fat burning ability. Since your body burns off alcohol first, it becomes your primary energy substrate. Drinking is not going to help you lose fat the easy way..</p><p>\nSo as you're burning off the alcohol, what happens to the food you eat? It's merely surplus calories going directly to fat cells. Not good. That means when you do choose to drink, don't eat a lot while you indulge. Here is what diet guru Robert C Atkins says regarding alcohol's effects on fat storage:\n<blockquote>\"Here's the problem with all alcoholic beverages, and the reason I recommend refraining from alcohol consumption on the diet. Alcohol, whenever taken in, is the first fuel to burn. While that's going on, your body will not burn fat. This does not stop the weight loss, it simply postpones it, since the alcohol does not store as glycogen, and you immediately go back into ketosis/lipolysis after the alcohol is used up.\n\nIf you must drink alcohol, wine is an acceptable addition to levels beyond the Induction diet. If wine does not suit your taste, straight liquor such as scotch, rye, vodka, and gin would be appropriate, as long as the mixer is sugarless; this means no juice, tonic water; or non-diet soda. Seltzer and diet soda are appropriate.\"</blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>3. Slow Down the Negative Part of Your Reps</strong></h3>\nOn at least one set of your big compound exercises, use a 1 1/2-seconds-up, 4-to-6-seconds-down tempo. In other words, slow down the negative on every rep.\n\nFor example, on bench presses, fire it up, then lower it slowly on every rep. Emphasizing the negative creates more muscle trauma, and that's a good thing in your pursuit to lose fat. That's because it takes energy to repair muscle damage. Your metabolism kicks into gear for the entire recovery process, usually about two days or more after your workout. So you're burning 24/7, not a bad way to lose fat.

That's why it's best to do your workout as soon as you wake up. Plus, you get it out of the way before your day gets started.\n\nI wake up at 5 or 6 a.m. six days a week and work out before I do anything else. This is great for everyone that claims to not have enough time to exercise.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>5. Do a Short Cardio Session After Each Weight Workout</strong></h3>\nYou burn off all the sugar in your bloodstream with 30 minutes to an hour of weight training. That means any activity right after immediately taps into body fat. I STRONGLY suggest you do HIIT cardio because it's by far the most effective for burning fat.\n\nIn other words, right after your weight training is prime fat-burning time.

I know that I say <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/how-to-build-bigger-stronger-biceps-with-21s-video/\" target=\"_blank\">NEVER COUNT REPS</a>, but 21's are the best workout for biceps.\n\nFirst you will need to pick a weight on a barbell, ez-curl, Dumbbells, or Resistances Bands that will be moderately challenging for you. Maybe about 70% of the weight you use for regular sets of 10. For example, being able to curl 110 pounds 10 times may require you to drop down to about 80 pounds for this particular exercise.\n<h3>How To do 21's (see video below)</h3>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5K-evCGNa6U\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The exercise is best described as doing 3 exercises back to back, isolating different parts of you biceps.</li>\n \t<li>The first movement you will be making is basically half of a curl. Have the bar at your waist and lift until your forearms are parallel to the floor, stop, lower the weight and repeat 7 times.</li>\n \t<li>Without rest, after your 7th rep, start in the position that you ended with in the last movement (forearms parallel to the floor) and then bring the bar to your neck, back down to the starting position and back up to your neck for 7 reps.

To complete this exercise, finish it off with 7 more full motion curls to make the total 21 reps (Hence the name).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Doing the Curl Right</h3>\nThe key to any bicep exercise is proper movement. With abs there is a little leeway, you can do a crunch and twist your torso and you roll up. With biceps you are very limited.\n\nThe bicep is the muscle that lifts your forearm at the elbow joint. Therefore when you do the exercise the only thing that can move is the bicep joint. Once you rock your body back and forth, move the shoulder joint, curl your wrist, use your hips to start the momentum. . . you lose the bicep isolation.\n\nSo focus very hard on the elbow joint. Try to avoid any side-to-side movement and have it fluidly pull your forearm toward your shoulder. 21's are the best workout for biceps, but not if you do them wrong.\n<h3>Stretch out the Biceps</h3>\nBefore you begin any workouts it's a good idea to get a good stretch in. For biceps there are some specific ones that focus entirely on that muscle.\n\nI like the doorway/shelf/pole stretch.\n\nFind an anchor point, like a doorway or pole and stand next to it an arm's length away. Then reach straight out with your arm parallel to the ground and grab that anchor with your thumb facing down . Then rotate your body away from your hand very slowly feeling the stretch in your bicep muscle.\n\nMake sure to do this slowly.

They are always surprised when I tell them that them most important supplement is a basic multivitamin.</p><p> If  you're not taking them now, you better change that immediately if you want to meet your fitness goals.\n\nI started taking a Multivitamin EVERYDAY about 10 years ago, and I have been sick less than 5 times in the the last 10 years!!!\n\n<strong>What Is A Multi And Why Do I Need One?</strong>\n\nFor the human body to complete all the tasks it has in a normal day, it must be given a wide and complex variety of vital nutrients. Becoming deficient in any one of these essential vitamins or minerals causes breakdown of the metabolic pathway that produces optimum efficiency and performance goes down quick. Obviously, this is NOT what you want!\n\nMaking sure you take a high-potency multivitamin/multi-mineral formula may help ensure the presence of those essential nutrients necessary for thousands of metabolic reactions.\n\nBodybuilders, athletes, and people that lead active lifestyles need even more nutrients than the average non-active person. So if you think that just grabbing the first one you see on the shelf is going to work for you, think again.\n\nWithout the multi, I am convinced that the other supplements you take will not be as effective. Not only is the multi the foundation of a great supplement strategy, it should be the first thing you take care of. First thing when you get up in the morning, take your multi.\n\nDone.\n\nYou are now ready to go with whatever it is you have to do for the day. If you are in serious training, then you'll find support for faster recovery by taking your multi as soon as you finish working out.\n\n<strong>What Makes Up A Multi?</strong>\nNow some multis have small differences from others, but for the most part, the multi is comprised of the same individual vitamins and minerals. Even though they are normally packaged together in multis, there are differences between the two.\n\n<strong>1. Vitamins</strong>\nVitamins are organic. They are more complex than minerals. All vitamins are required by our bodies for survival. Vitamins control the chemical reactions within the body to convert food into energy and living tissue. They are either water soluble which must be taken daily since they are not stored in the body (Vitamin C and all of the B Vitamins) or fat soluble, which are stored in the body (A, D, E, and K).\n\nVitamins are vulnerable to heat, light, and chemical agents, so food preparation, processing, and storing it must be appropriate to preserve vitamins so you get the nutritional value out of the meal.\n\n<strong>Vitamin Basic Function</strong>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>A</strong> - Vision, healthy skin and mucous membranes, bone and tooth growth, immune system health</li>\n \t<li><strong>B complex</strong> -Important for nerve function, normal vision and skin health, nervous and digestive systems</li>\n \t<li><strong>C-</strong> Immune system and protects cells</li>\n \t<li><strong>D-</strong> Absorption and use of calcium</li>\n \t<li><strong>E-</strong> Powerful antioxidant</li>\n \t<li><strong>K-</strong> Bones, teeth and cartilage health</li>\n \t<li><strong>Zinc -</strong>Immune System Health</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<strong>2. Minerals</strong>\nMinerals are inorganic. They are much simpler in chemical form than vitamins. They are much more stable in food preparation than vitamins also. Minerals are categorized as major/macro - (calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, and sulfur), and trace/micro- (iron, iodine, zinc, chromium, selenium, fluoride, molybdenum, copper, and manganese) minerals.\n\nMajor minerals we need in dosages greater than 100 mg a day. The trace minerals we only need \"trace\" amounts of daily to suffice. Minerals are used to produce necessary hormones. A simpler way to remember this is that all minerals are found on the periodic table.\n\n<strong>Mineral Basic Function</strong>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Boron -</strong> Metabolism of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous</li>\n \t<li><strong>Calcium-</strong> Strong and healthy normal bones</li>\n \t<li><strong>Chromium-</strong> Insulin Production Copper- Strengthen connective tissue</li>\n \t<li><strong>Iodine -</strong>Thyroid Hormone Synthesis</li>\n \t<li><strong>Iron -</strong>Carries oxygen within protein hemoglobin</li>\n \t<li><strong>Lutein -</strong>Eye Health</li>\n \t<li><strong>Lycopene-</strong> Heart Health, Supports Healthy Cholesterol</li>\n \t<li><strong>Magnesium-</strong> Over 300 biochemical reactions of body</li>\n \t<li><strong>Manganese-</strong> Co-factor in energy production, activator of many enzymes</li>\n \t<li><strong>Molybdenum-</strong> Supports normal liver and kidney health</li>\n \t<li><strong>Nickel-</strong> Healthy skin and bone structure</li>\n \t<li><strong>Potassium-</strong> Used by Autonomic Nervous System (heart beat, brain function)</li>\n \t<li><strong>Selenium-</strong> Fights against many health problems</li>\n \t<li><strong>Vanadium-</strong> Works with Molybdenum</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\nHopefully by now you know and appreciate the true value of what a multivitamin means to your bodybuilding and fitness goals. The protein, energy drinks, and all the others are great, but without a multi, you are not meeting your true physical fitness potential.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you are male or female, young or old, bodybuilder, football player, or everyday gym rat.

They are always surprised when I tell them that them most important supplement is a basic multivitamin.</p><p> If  you're not taking them now, you better change that immediately if you want to meet your fitness goals.</p>\n\n<p>I started taking a Multivitamin EVERYDAY about 10 years ago, and I have been sick less than 5 times in the the last 10 years!!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Is A Multi And Why Do I Need One?</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the human body to complete all the tasks it has in a normal day, it must be given a wide and complex variety of vital nutrients. Becoming deficient in any one of these essential vitamins or minerals causes breakdown of the metabolic pathway that produces optimum efficiency and performance goes down quick. Obviously, this is NOT what you want!</p>\n\n<p>Making sure you take a high-potency multivitamin/multi-mineral formula may help ensure the presence of those essential nutrients necessary for thousands of metabolic reactions.</p>\n\n<p>Bodybuilders, athletes, and people that lead active lifestyles need even more nutrients than the average non-active person. So if you think that just grabbing the first one you see on the shelf is going to work for you, think again.</p>\n\n<p>Without the multi, I am convinced that the other supplements you take will not be as effective. Not only is the multi the foundation of a great supplement strategy, it should be the first thing you take care of. First thing when you get up in the morning, take your multi.</p>\n\n<p>Done.</p>\n\n<p>You are now ready to go with whatever it is you have to do for the day. If you are in serious training, then you'll find support for faster recovery by taking your multi as soon as you finish working out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Makes Up A Multi?</strong> <br />\nNow some multis have small differences from others, but for the most part, the multi is comprised of the same individual vitamins and minerals. Even though they are normally packaged together in multis, there are differences between the two.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Vitamins</strong> <br />\nVitamins are organic. They are more complex than minerals. All vitamins are required by our bodies for survival. Vitamins control the chemical reactions within the body to convert food into energy and living tissue. They are either water soluble which must be taken daily since they are not stored in the body (Vitamin C and all of the B Vitamins) or fat soluble, which are stored in the body (A, D, E, and K).</p>\n\n<p>Vitamins are vulnerable to heat, light, and chemical agents, so food preparation, processing, and storing it must be appropriate to preserve vitamins so you get the nutritional value out of the meal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Vitamin Basic Function</strong>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>  \n<ul>  \n     <li><strong>A</strong> - Vision, healthy skin and mucous membranes, bone and tooth growth, immune system health</li>\n     <li><strong>B complex</strong> -Important for nerve function, normal vision and skin health, nervous and digestive systems</li>\n     <li><strong>C-</strong> Immune system and protects cells</li>\n     <li><strong>D-</strong> Absorption and use of calcium</li>\n     <li><strong>E-</strong> Powerful antioxidant</li>\n     <li><strong>K-</strong> Bones, teeth and cartilage health</li>\n     <li><strong>Zinc -</strong>Immune System Health</li>\n</ul>  \n</blockquote>  \n\n<p><strong>2. Minerals</strong> <br />\nMinerals are inorganic. They are much simpler in chemical form than vitamins. They are much more stable in food preparation than vitamins also. Minerals are categorized as major/macro - (calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, and sulfur), and trace/micro- (iron, iodine, zinc, chromium, selenium, fluoride, molybdenum, copper, and manganese) minerals.</p>\n\n<p>Major minerals we need in dosages greater than 100 mg a day. The trace minerals we only need \"trace\" amounts of daily to suffice. Minerals are used to produce necessary hormones. A simpler way to remember this is that all minerals are found on the periodic table.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mineral Basic Function</strong>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>  \n<ul>  \n     <li><strong>Boron -</strong> Metabolism of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous</li>\n     <li><strong>Calcium-</strong> Strong and healthy normal bones</li>\n     <li><strong>Chromium-</strong> Insulin Production Copper- Strengthen connective tissue</li>\n     <li><strong>Iodine -</strong>Thyroid Hormone Synthesis</li>\n     <li><strong>Iron -</strong>Carries oxygen within protein hemoglobin</li>\n     <li><strong>Lutein -</strong>Eye Health</li>\n     <li><strong>Lycopene-</strong> Heart Health, Supports Healthy Cholesterol</li>\n     <li><strong>Magnesium-</strong> Over 300 biochemical reactions of body</li>\n     <li><strong>Manganese-</strong> Co-factor in energy production, activator of many enzymes</li>\n     <li><strong>Molybdenum-</strong> Supports normal liver and kidney health</li>\n     <li><strong>Nickel-</strong> Healthy skin and bone structure</li>\n     <li><strong>Potassium-</strong> Used by Autonomic Nervous System (heart beat, brain function)</li>\n     <li><strong>Selenium-</strong> Fights against many health problems</li>\n     <li><strong>Vanadium-</strong> Works with Molybdenum</li>\n</ul>  \n</blockquote>  \n\n<p>Hopefully by now you know and appreciate the true value of what a multivitamin means to your bodybuilding and fitness goals. The protein, energy drinks, and all the others are great, but without a multi, you are not meeting your true physical fitness potential.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn't matter whether you are male or female, young or old, bodybuilder, football player, or everyday gym rat. Your multi should be the first supplement you take every day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://brandoncarter.com/fat-loss-energy-supplement/\">To accelerate the fat loss and turn my body into a fat burning machine, I also take Tea Rexx everyday.

Of course, a lot of supplements out there these days are based on junk science with studies often funded by the supplement companies themselves. This is why I always do my homework before giving a supplement serious consideration. Betaine anhydrous, though, is one vitamin that gets my stamp of approval.\n<h3>What Is It?</h3>\nAlso going by the much more tongue-twisting name trimethylglycine, betaine anhydrous is a valuable member of the B complex vitamins that assists the body in numerous day-to-day functions.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22230937/4732641005_c1a57d841e_m.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2509\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22230937/4732641005_c1a57d841e_m.jpg\" alt=\"4732641005_c1a57d841e_m\" width=\"240\" height=\"159\" /></a>\n\nOne of its main purposes is to reduce excess levels of homocysteine in the body. Homocysteine is an amino acid produced during the digestion of meat. In moderation, homocysteine is healthy for the body and aids in cellular metabolism. Too much of the amino acid, though, is believed to increase the risk for conditions like cardiovascular thrombosis and osteoporosis.\n\n<a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/3/539.full\">Studies</a> have also shown that betaine anhydrous plays a key role in kidney and intestinal function maintenance.\n<h3>What Else Does It Do?</h3>\nVitamins are hardly single-benefit nutrients, and betaine anhydrous is no exception. The vitamin is also an ingredient in various energy and weight loss supplements due to its thermogenic properties. Betaine anhydrous is believed to aid in fat loss by promoting oxidization of lipids and improving digestion. Furthermore, a recent <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21747291\">study</a> has also shown that supplementation of the vitamin helps offset fatigue during exercise.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2562\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/26151410/rebellion-brandon.png\" alt=\"rebellion-brandon\" width=\"698\" height=\"466\" />\n\nAnother <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22080324\">study</a> also showed that men who supplemented with betaine anhydrous experienced less lactate buildup during exercise and were able to perform more repetitions of certain exercises compared to a placebo group.\n\nThe last study is what really convinced me that betaine anhydrous has valuable use as a pre-workout formula. You know I’m all about training to absolute failure for getting the best results. If betaine anhydrous can help you get in that last rep or two, then it’s definitely a booster I want in my bodybuilding arsenal.\n<h3>Give Yourself an Edge</h3>\nPerformance supplements of any kind should always be taken with a grain of salt. There are very few products out there that contain ingredients that have been clinically proven in independent studies. This is why I put my reputation behind <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\">Rebellion</a>. It contains no fluff and only uses ingredients that have been verified to enhance athletic performance. Betaine anhydrous is among the ingredients because it has been proven to work.\n\n[photo credits: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/31687107@N07/7239650798\">aerobithon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/42454758@N08/4482865200\">BritaFilterForGood</a>, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/43673788@N07/4732641005\">apfelfred</a>]","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22225238/7239650798_17f97fa2ec_b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2506\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22225238/7239650798_17f97fa2ec_b.jpg\" alt=\"7239650798_17f97fa2ec_b\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We included beta anhydrous in our Rebellion formula for a reason.

Betaine anhydrous, though, is one vitamin that gets my stamp of approval.  </p>\n\n<h3>What Is It?</h3>  \n\n<p>Also going by the much more tongue-twisting name trimethylglycine, betaine anhydrous is a valuable member of the B complex vitamins that assists the body in numerous day-to-day functions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22230937/4732641005_c1a57d841e_m.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2509\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22230937/4732641005_c1a57d841e_m.jpg\" alt=\"4732641005_c1a57d841e_m\" width=\"240\" height=\"159\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One of its main purposes is to reduce excess levels of homocysteine in the body. Homocysteine is an amino acid produced during the digestion of meat. In moderation, homocysteine is healthy for the body and aids in cellular metabolism. Too much of the amino acid, though, is believed to increase the risk for conditions like cardiovascular thrombosis and osteoporosis.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/3/539.full\">Studies</a> have also shown that betaine anhydrous plays a key role in kidney and intestinal function maintenance.  </p>\n\n<h3>What Else Does It Do?</h3>  \n\n<p>Vitamins are hardly single-benefit nutrients, and betaine anhydrous is no exception. The vitamin is also an ingredient in various energy and weight loss supplements due to its thermogenic properties. Betaine anhydrous is believed to aid in fat loss by promoting oxidization of lipids and improving digestion. Furthermore, a recent <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21747291\">study</a> has also shown that supplementation of the vitamin helps offset fatigue during exercise.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2562\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/26151410/rebellion-brandon.png\" alt=\"rebellion-brandon\" width=\"698\" height=\"466\" /></p>\n\n<p>Another <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22080324\">study</a> also showed that men who supplemented with betaine anhydrous experienced less lactate buildup during exercise and were able to perform more repetitions of certain exercises compared to a placebo group.</p>\n\n<p>The last study is what really convinced me that betaine anhydrous has valuable use as a pre-workout formula. You know I’m all about training to absolute failure for getting the best results. If betaine anhydrous can help you get in that last rep or two, then it’s definitely a booster I want in my bodybuilding arsenal.  </p>\n\n<h3>Give Yourself an Edge</h3>  \n\n<p>Performance supplements of any kind should always be taken with a grain of salt. There are very few products out there that contain ingredients that have been clinically proven in independent studies. This is why I put my reputation behind <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\">Rebellion</a>. It contains no fluff and only uses ingredients that have been verified to enhance athletic performance. Betaine anhydrous is among the ingredients because it has been proven to work.</p>\n\n<p>[photo credits: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/31687107@N07/7239650798\">aerobithon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/42454758@N08/4482865200\">BritaFilterForGood</a>, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/43673788@N07/4732641005\">apfelfred</a>]</p>","amp":null,"image":"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/12/2015-03-30-21.28.54.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-04-26 19:13:20","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-04-26 19:13:20","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-04-26 19:13:20","published_by":1},{"id":2139,"uuid":"905e06f2-917c-49b3-bb53-d5fd9336e48e","title":"4,000 Calorie Meal Plan for Monstrous Muscle Gains","slug":"4000-calorie-meal-plan-for-monstrous-muscle-gains","markdown":"<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/25192157/24707050_12be1d96a8_b.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2537\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/25192157/24707050_12be1d96a8_b.jpg\" alt=\"24707050_12be1d96a8_b\" width=\"1024\" height=\"767\" /></a>\n\nMuscle needs fuel to grow, and that fuel is whatever you put in your mouth. If you want freaky muscles, then you need to eat more than your body burns; it’s that simple. A 4,000 calorie meal plan is perfect for workout days and is especially suitable for men trying to put on as much muscle weight in the shortest amount of time possible.\n<h3>Will Eating 4,000 Calories Make Me Fat?</h3>\nIt is not unusual for men trying to gain muscle to consume 4,000, 5000, or even 6,000 calories and upwards on the days they train. Certainly, this is far above the 2,500-calorie daily recommendation for men. Will this type of bulk-up diet make you fat in the process? It will NOT make you fat if you do it my way. Most people who go on these types of massive eating diets gain muscle but also put on fat because they allow themselves too much leeway in the types of foods they eat.\n<h3>Limit 4,000-Calories to Your Strength Training Days</h3>\nWhether you consume fewer calories to lose fat or eat more to gain muscle, you need to vary your intake depending on the day of the week. For muscle gain, consume 4,000 calories on the day you train. For non-training days, or days that you only do cardo, limit calories to about 2,500, give or take a few hundred.\n\nSeveral hardgainers I met consume 4,000 calories or more every day believing it’s the fastest way to build muscle mass. Eating too much on a daily basis will result in fat gain. On top of that, gains in lean mass will also come to a halt because your metabolism will speed up to adapt to the enormous food intake.\n<h3>Sample Traditional Meal Plan</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">7:00 am breakfast</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 cup whole milk, 1/2 cup oatmeal, 1 fruit, 2 eggs</td>\n<td width=\"213\">600 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">10:00 am pre-workout meal</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 cup whole milk, 1 scoop whey protein, 1 fruit, bagel w/ peanut butter, 2 eggs scrambled</td>\n<td width=\"213\">900 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">12:00 pm post-workout meal</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 cup whole milk, 1 scoop whey protein, 1 fruit, lean beef, steamed vegetables, 1 whole potato, 2 eggs</td>\n<td width=\"213\">900 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">3:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Chicken breast sandwich on whole wheat bread w/ cheddar cheese &amp; olive oil dressing, 1 fruit, 1 cup whole milk</td>\n<td width=\"213\">700 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">6:00 pm dinner</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Lean beef, 2 yams steamed vegetables, 1 cup whole milk, 2 eggs</td>\n<td width=\"213\">550 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">9:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 cup whole milk, ½ cup nuts</td>\n<td width=\"213\">350 calories</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThere are a few points I like to make about the meal plan. As you may have noticed, the pre and post-workout meals are the largest meals. This is because your body will be starving for fuel during and after a workout. As a rule of thumb, both of these meals alone should consist of half or close to half of your total daily intake. For a 4,000-calorie diet, this would mean in the range of 1,800-2,000 calories.\n<h3>Intermittent Fasting</h3>\nYou should know that this is recognizing that some people live in a traditional meal plan world.</p><p>If you're interested in learning more about intermittent fasting, we have more information on that as well. Or ask me and I'll develop a plan for you with that.\n<h3>A few Other Notes</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/23135111/milk-body-building-food.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1911\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/23135111/milk-body-building-food-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"milk-body-building-food\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nYou may have also noticed that the meal consists of a lot of whole milk. In fact, one cup of milk is included in every meal. This is because milk is an excellent source of protein. In addition, it’s also easier to consume calories from liquids than it is from solid foods. These high calorie diets are not easy to follow if you’re new to them, so you want to have plenty of milk to help you meet your daily requirements.\n\nFour out of the six meals also include eggs. A lot of people are worried about consuming eggs due to the high cholesterol. However, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2013/01/15/large-meta-analysis-finds-no-harm-associated-with-eggs/\">recent studies</a> have established that egg consumption does not elevate risk for coronary disease or stroke. On top of that, cholesterol is a necessary component for the production of testosterone.\n<h3>What About Carbs?</h3>\nAs stated by myself as well as many other fitness insiders, with the exception of fruit, carbs should almost be entirely from complex sources. You may, however, give yourself some leeway during the pre and post-workout meals since calories from refined carbs are rapidly used by the body following an intense workout. As far as ratio goes, you may consume slightly more carbs than you would for fat loss. A ratio of 50% protein, 15% fat, and 35% carbs should suffice.\n<h3>Let Me Help</h3>\nI realize high-calorie diets may be difficult to follow especially for naturally skinny guys.

I sure as heck feel that way more often than I would like to admit.\n\nSo what do you do to give yourself that buzz and high when you’re feeling unmotivated and tired? There’s actually a proven ingredient to skyrocket your energy levels in a manner of minutes.\n\nThe ingredient is L-citrulline malate. Yeah, it’s kind of an unknown ingredient, but it has been proven in countless independent studies to work wonders for the human body. Its benefits actually go beyond amping up your energy levels.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/18203656/8114102549_f7513ca335_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2476\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/18203656/8114102549_f7513ca335_n.jpg\" alt=\"8114102549_f7513ca335_n\" width=\"239\" height=\"320\" /></a>\n\nL-citrulline malate is an amino acid that’s been dubbed the “fatigue fighter” in some bodybuilding circles. Bear with me as I get a bit scientific here. Citrulline is the by-product of the combination of carbamoyl phosphate and the amino acid ornithine. The resulting citrulline is used during what is known as the body’s urea cycle, a process in which the body excretes nitrogen waste.\n\nOkay, so citrulline definitely sounds like a valuable amino acid, but how does it help me in the gym? Well, it’s believed that when there is an excess amount of citrulline, the urea cycle disposes excess ammonia from the body. Ammonia is produced by the muscles during physical activity and is believed to be a primary factor in fatigue.\n<h3>Where’s the Proof?</h3>\nThe explanation certainly sounds promising, but as with any other supplement, you need solid proof that such a compound actually does what is claimed. L-citrulline malate has been shown in clinical studies to increase energy output during strenuous training.\n\nIn this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145119\">study</a> consisting of 18 men, fatigue was significantly delayed when the subjects underwent a finger flexion exercise.\n<h3>Another Interesting L-Citrulline Malate Fact</h3>\nHere’s another interesting food for thought regarding citrulline. The amino acid has also been shown in <a href=\"http://gut.bmj.com/content/53/12/1781.short\">studies</a> to lead to the production of arginine. Arginine is another amino acid that, in turn, stimulates blood flow by producing more nitric oxide (NO). If you’re familiar with NO supplements or have even tried them yourselves, then you know just how effective they can be as a pre-workout supplement.\n<h3>One Last Fact Worthy of Mention (if You’re a Guy)</h3>\nHere’s something else that you might be pleased to know if you’re a dude. L-citrulline malate has also been proven to increase erection hardness.  It’s true, and the proof is in the pudding with this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195829\">study</a>.\n<h3>Give It a Shot</h3>\nIf you can honestly say that you feel absolutely energized and motivated before every workout, then more power to you. However, that is simply not the case for most of us, myself included. Sometimes, we need a little kick to get us into that mode where we just absolutely feel incredible and ready to hit the weight room. L-citrulline malate is an ingredient that just might help put you in that state.\n\nIf you’re looking for a no nonsense pre-workout formula, then I suggest you give <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\">Rebellion</a> a try.

As far as 2,000 calories go, the frequency depends on whether muscle gains or fat loss is your main goal.\n\nIf building muscle is your main priority, then you need to consume more calories than your body burns, and that entails more than 2,000 calories a day. Nevertheless, there are days when you should consume slightly less calories to prevent your metabolism from speeding up. In this scenario, I would limit 2,000 calories to once or twice a week and on non-strength training days.\n\nIf you are primarily trying to lose fat, then 2,000 calories a day can be consumed three to five times a week. There can also be days where you consume less and one day a week where you consume more (your cheat day).\n\nBasically, for fat loss, a weekly meal plan may look something like the following:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Monday (strength training, HIIT cardio)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Tuesday (HIIT cardio)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Wednesday (rest)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Thursday (HIIT cardio)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">1,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Friday (strength, HIIT cardio)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Saturday (HIIT Cardio)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Sunday (rest, cheat day)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2,500-3,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n\nSo far, this post has been catered to men, but in case you’re a woman and have read up to this point, here is how a 2,000 calorie diet would be utilized for females:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Monday (strength training, HIIT cardio)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Tuesday (HIIT cardio)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">1,000-1,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Wednesday (rest)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">1,000-1,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Thursday (HIIT cardio)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">1,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Friday (strength training, HIIT cardio)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Saturday (HIIT Cardio)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">1,000-1,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Sunday (rest, cheat day)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2,000-2,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Counting Food Portions Instead of Calories</h3>\nFor better accuracy, it’s always best to count calories. However, not all foods come with labels. In this case, you can guesstimate using portions. One food portion is about the size of your fist, and one portion counts as 150 calories. On a 2,000 calorie diet, you would consume 13 to 14 portions of food. One whole piece of fruit would also be counted as one portion, as would one cup of milk or juice.\n<h3>It’s Perfect for Long-Term Fat Loss</h3>\nFor men specifically, 2,000 calorie meal plans work well because it’s slightly lower than their <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/category/nutrition\">daily recommended food intake</a>. At the same time, it’s not so low that it causes hunger pangs; it’s also an amount that can be included long-term into a weekly meal plan. In other words, you'll feel satiated and won't hear your tummy growling.\n\nLet me incorporate a 2,000 calorie diet into a <a href=\"http://brolabsmealplan.com/\">customized meal plan</a> catered specifically for your body type and goals. A personalized diet ensures you build rock hard muscle while simultaneously stripping away fat to reveal the six-pack underneath.\n\n[photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/13194817@N00/4219461134\">F Delventhal</a>]","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22202109/4219461134_9af0f093b3_b.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2501\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22202109/4219461134_9af0f093b3_b.jpg\" alt=\"4219461134_9af0f093b3_b\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While considered the daily average for women, 2,000 calories is below average for guys.

Yes, some people actually drink <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/fighter-fuel\">coffee </a>for the taste, but most people drink it for the energy boost to kick start their day. Caffeine really is as natural as it gets, and aside from getting you through that day in the office, it also helps supercharge your workouts.\n<h3>How Caffeine Works</h3>\nIt’s common knowledge that caffeine is a stimulant. Few people, however, know how it actually works. I won’t dive into all the science; all you need to know is that caffeine is a naturally occurring chemical found in the leaves and seeds of various plant species, such as the Guarana, yerba mate, cacao, and of course, coffee beans.\n\nCaffeine works its magic by binding to adenosine receptors in the brain. This leaves less available adenosine receptors available for adenosine to bind to. When adenosine binds with the receptors, it slows nerve cell activity, thus causing drowsiness.\n<h3>Is Caffeine Safe?</h3>\nI’m just going to get right to the chase here because there is so much literature out there regarding the supposed dangers of caffeine. As with any other stimulant or natural drug, there are side effects if you consume way beyond the daily maximum 400 mg dosage recommended by health experts. Any worries about health implications are unfounded as long as you stay within the daily allowance.\n<h3>There’s More Benefits Beyond Delivering an Energy Spike</h3>\nThere are a host of other caffeine benefits that people aren’t aware of. Caffeine is also your friend if you’re trying to lose fat. Caffeine has also been proven to have a thermogenic effect on the body, meaning it raises metabolism. This has been verified in clinical research and can be found in this <a href=\"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2012/FO/c2fo30053b#!divAbstract\">study</a>.\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2575\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/26154542/brandon-carter-brandon.png\" alt=\"brandon-carter-brandon\" width=\"400\" />\n\nFurthermore, this <a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/262481.php\">study</a> also revealed that caffeine may also aid in weight loss by acting as an appetite suppressant.\n\nOther <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-3010.2007.00665.x/full\">studies</a> have also showed that caffeine may have nootropic properties by enhancing memory and cognitive function.\n\nHere’s the most impressive benefit of all for athletes: caffeine has been proven in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901809\">studies</a> to enhance post-exercise energy expenditure. This means you won’t feel as spent after completing a grueling workout and will have more energy to go around for the rest of your day.\n\nNeed more reasons to be convinced of the amazing wonders of caffeine? Here’s one more: One <a href=\"http://fitness.mercola.com/sites/fitness/archive/2014/07/11/6-coffee-pre-workout-benefits.aspx\">Spanish study</a> revealed that caffeine users burned 15% more calories for three hours after exercise compared to a placebo group.\n<h3>Supplement With Caffeine to Get the Most out of Your Workout</h3>\nI think it’s safe to say that we have all felt that afternoon or early evening energy slump.

One sunny afternoon, I was in front of the cafeteria talking to Brittney and her friends, trying my best to impress her that day. I had on my best clothes, my favorite cologne and some brand new sneakers. I wore all of that on <i>this</i> particular day because I knew I would see Brittney after lunch.\n\nI was going out of my way to impress her and her friends. I was going out of my way to make her and her friends  laugh and keep them entertained. Everything was going great. They were responding to me and enjoying the stand up comedy spectacle I was putting on...\n\nUntil <i>James</i> Showed up.\n\nJames didn’t go to our college (I’m pretty sure he didn’t even graduate from high school)... But James<i> had it</i>. He was <i>Awesome</i>. He was extremely wealthy, talented and in amazing shape.\n\nWhen Brittney and her friends realized that James was on campus, they leaped from the bench they were sitting on and literally ran past me while I was in the middle of a sentence. My heart sank as Brittney pushed out of the way as she and her friends ran to James.\n\nA wave of depression and embarrassment engulfed my soul as Brittney, her friends, and a bunch of other girls from campus mobbed James to talk to him and take pictures with him.\n\nI realize that I was doing everything I could, working as hard as possible get Brittney’s attention and affection - while James didn’t have to do ANYTHING... He just had to show up!\n\nWhy was it so easy for James? <i>Because he was AWESOME.</i>\n\nAt that moment I made<b> I made a commitment to becoming AWESOME</b>. It took a lot of hard work and a ton of trial and error, but I finally reached a level where I can call myself AWESOME.\n\nI am a bestselling author of multiple books.

Instead of simply accomplishing your goals or trying to get them done...you have to want to MURDER AND DESTROY your goals! You need to want to grab them by there head and punt them off the field! Do not be shy and timid when approaching your goals. Come at your goals with the ferocity and determination of a supreme alpha lion or wolf! That should be the foundation of your mind so that you can come at your goal with a proper attitude and approach.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18122919/BlogPhotos.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1501\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18122919/BlogPhotos-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Kill Your Goals \" width=\"1073\" height=\"604\" /></a> Kill Your Goals\n\nAfter you understand how to maintain the basic foundation of the mindset, you can begin to move on to specific strategies and tactics of effective goal setting.\n\nFirst off, take what the average person would accomplish in a year, and attempt to complete that in 3 months. You want to knock out your goals fast and effectively and accomplish (what would take the average person four years) something profound in one year. While you should not be unrealistic with your goal, really push yourself to your limits to see what your are capable of accomplishing.\n\nSecond, reverse engineer the steps it would take to meet your goal. Break down the three months and schedule what needs to be accomplished per week. You can start at the end and go backwards or you can start in the front and plan forward. Occasionally, the final steps of goals can be foggy and unclear. In that case, just take the first step and keep on pushing upward.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18135652/img_20150817_062845_1024.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1503 aligncenter\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18135652/img_20150817_062845_1024-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"img_20150817_062845_1024\" width=\"527\" height=\"527\" /></a>.</p><p>\nEach week, maintain focus on just what needs to be accomplished that particular week and knock it out. Do not spend too much time overthinking the steps in the future and focus aggressively on the present day action that is required. Attack each week with the foundation mindset required to murder your goals!\n\nIf you just take this simple basic plan and put it into effect, you will see your results drastically increase!\n\n&nbsp;","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Have you ever set a goal and not fulfilled it?

That should be the foundation of your mind so that you can come at your goal with a proper attitude and approach.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18122919/BlogPhotos.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1501\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18122919/BlogPhotos-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Kill Your Goals \" width=\"1073\" height=\"604\" /></a> Kill Your Goals</p>\n\n<p>After you understand how to maintain the basic foundation of the mindset, you can begin to move on to specific strategies and tactics of effective goal setting.</p>\n\n<p>First off, take what the average person would accomplish in a year, and attempt to complete that in 3 months. You want to knock out your goals fast and effectively and accomplish (what would take the average person four years) something profound in one year. While you should not be unrealistic with your goal, really push yourself to your limits to see what your are capable of accomplishing.</p>\n\n<p>Second, reverse engineer the steps it would take to meet your goal. Break down the three months and schedule what needs to be accomplished per week. You can start at the end and go backwards or you can start in the front and plan forward. Occasionally, the final steps of goals can be foggy and unclear. In that case, just take the first step and keep on pushing upward. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18135652/img_20150817_062845_1024.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1503 aligncenter\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18135652/img_20150817_062845_1024-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"img_20150817_062845_1024\" width=\"527\" height=\"527\" /></a>.</p><p> <br />\nEach week, maintain focus on just what needs to be accomplished that particular week and knock it out. Do not spend too much time overthinking the steps in the future and focus aggressively on the present day action that is required. Attack each week with the foundation mindset required to murder your goals!</p>\n\n<p>If you just take this simple basic plan and put it into effect, you will see your results drastically increase!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","amp":null,"image":"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/09/IMG_4170.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-08-18 18:06:08","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-08-18 18:06:08","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-08-18 18:06:08","published_by":1},{"id":2170,"uuid":"2cc18642-e302-4b3b-b5a6-01462530cf4c","title":"Six Pack Abs Workout Plan: On the Beach","slug":"beach-abs-workout","markdown":"Get your abs looking ripped for the beach with a new quick 4 minute abdominal workout !\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv6yon4BBoE\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nWorkout Description:\n\nIron Butterflies (20 seconds)\nRest (10 seconds)\nSpiderman Planks (20 seconds)\nRest (10 seconds)\nRoman Twist (20 seconds)\nRest (10 seconds)\nAss Taps (20 seconds)\nRest (10 seconds)\nIron Butterflies (20 seconds)\nRest (10 seconds)\nSpiderman Planks (20 seconds)\nRest (10 seconds)\nRoman Twist (20 seconds)\nRest (10 seconds)\nAss Taps (20 seconds)\n\nDo this every day and your going to start getting those beach abs you always dreamed of.

With that being said, being in a constant state of calorie deficit is totally the wrong way to go about it. You can’t starve yourself to a slimmer body. Even so, an occasional low-calorie day may help burn off a few extra pounds in less time. My 1,000 calorie meal plan is designed for just that.\n<h3>Subsiding on 1,000 Calories a Day</h3>\nIf subsiding on 1,000 calories a day sounds unsustainable, that’s because it is, especially for men. Dietary guidelines recommend 1,700-2,000 calories for women and about 2,500 for men. Even if you were able to get by on 1,000 calories a day, it would not produce sustained fat loss.\n\nYour body doesn’t care about having six-pack abs; what it cares about is survival, and it is very sufficient at altering its metabolism to keep the body going. If you consistently consume low calories on a day-to-day basis, then your body will adapt by lowering its metabolism. The same principle applies for people consuming more calories to gain muscle weight. If you consistently consume more calories, then your body well adapt by increasing metabolism.\n<h3>The Trick? Keep Your Body Guessing</h3>\nThis is why I am a big proponent of cheat days. Aside from fighting off cravings, cheat days also allow you one day out of the week to consume more food than you normally would. This keeps your body from adapting to a lower calorie intake if you’re on a fat loss regimen.\n\nFor women, 1,000 calories is somewhat more manageable and can be done three to four times a week. For men, I would recommend no more than once to twice a week. Let’s face it: us guys are not meant to eat a meager 1,000 calories a day. For males, 1,000-calorie days are more meant for keeping the body guessing, which can be really effective if combined with a cheat day. For both men and women, reserve these days for your non-strength training days.\n<h3>Sample Meal Plan</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">8:00 am</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 fruit, oatmeal,  1 cup milk</td>\n<td width=\"213\">350 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">10:30 am</td>\n<td width=\"213\">½ cup nuts</td>\n<td width=\"213\">150 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">1:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Chicken breast, mixed vegetables, ½ cup rice</td>\n<td width=\"213\">300 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">4:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 fruit</td>\n<td width=\"213\">100 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">7:30 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 cup milk</td>\n<td width=\"213\">100 calories</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n\nFor an added boost, you can also limit the carbs and place a greater ratio on protein and healthy fats.\n\nWhen consuming only 1,000 calories a day, you’ll feel slight hunger pangs. Don’t worry, though, you’ll live. To help you cope, you can munch on vegetables, which provide a good dose of vitamins and nutrients while having very few calories. Some people also recommend chewing gum as a way of keeping your appetite at bay, though <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/chewing-gum-study-researchers-say-it-can-make-you-overweight-hungry-increases-concentration-1154547\">recent research</a> suggests that gum chewing may actually have the opposite effect.\n<h3>Give It a Shot</h3>\nA 1,000 calorie meal plan is not meant to be followed on a daily basis. Believe me, you won’t be able to keep it up, and it will only erode your long-term health. Eating that amount on a sporadic basis, though, works nicely when incorporated into a more comprehensive and complete weekly meal plan.\n\nIf fat loss is your main fitness goal, then let me <a href=\"http://brolabsmealplan.com/\">customize a meal plan</a> that includes an occasional 1,000 calorie meal plan.\n\n[photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/92839381@N00/4589609493\">food swings</a>]","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22202632/4589609493_05666dbcec_b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2502\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22202632/4589609493_05666dbcec_b.jpg\" alt=\"4589609493_05666dbcec_b\" width=\"1024\" height=\"986\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>How many of us attempt 1,000 calorie meal plans for fat loss?  And fail because 9 peanuts per days it not enough?</p>\n\n<p>Well, to lose fat, your body has to burn more calories than you’re consuming.

That's why today we're going to focus on how to build your triceps into mighty machines.\n\nTriceps make up the majority muscle mass of the upper arm. The Triceps run along the humerus (the main bone of the upper arm) between the shoulder blade and the elbow. The triceps muscle has 3 heads versus the biceps 2 heads.\n\n3 heads means that the muscle works 3 different ways. When we talk about building your triceps, ultimately that means there are 3 angles to work the muscle.\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/30105406/how-to-build-your-triceps.jpg\" alt=\"how-to-build-your-triceps\" height=\"300\" /></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nLet's talk about 3 different exercises to really take build some fantastic, sexy triceps.\n<h2>Tricep Pushdowns</h2>\nThe key to building triceps is arm angle. The shoulder, delts, lats and biceps are very close by. So the angle and movement of the arm will make all the difference.\n\nThe movement we want is the same as a bicep curl, but we want the opposite force. With a bicep curl we curl the arm from the elbow down up to the shoulder. And in that curl we want the weight to go up toward the sky - curling against gravity.\n\nThe tricep pushdown, whether you use a bar, resistance bands or rope, works by placing the resistance above your head and pushing down. By pushing down you reverse the curl motion and are forced to use the back of the arm, the tricep.\n\nTechnique is very important as we stated. Start by pressing your elbows against the side of your torso not allowing them to flare out. Start with your elbows bent at 90 degrees so your forearms are parallel with the floor. Press down on the bar or the rope and extend your elbows until your arms are straight and finish alongside your thighs. Straighten and control your forearms back up to starting position.\n\nUsing a rope for a tricep pushdown requires you to use your arm stabilizer muscles as well.

That's why today we're going to focus on how to build your triceps into mighty machines.</p>\n\n<p>Triceps make up the majority muscle mass of the upper arm. The Triceps run along the humerus (the main bone of the upper arm) between the shoulder blade and the elbow. The triceps muscle has 3 heads versus the biceps 2 heads.</p>\n\n<p>3 heads means that the muscle works 3 different ways. When we talk about building your triceps, ultimately that means there are 3 angles to work the muscle.  </p>\n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td></td>  \n<td valign=\"top\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/30105406/how-to-build-your-triceps.jpg\" alt=\"how-to-build-your-triceps\" height=\"300\" /></td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<p>Let's talk about 3 different exercises to really take build some fantastic, sexy triceps.  </p>\n\n<h2>Tricep Pushdowns</h2>  \n\n<p>The key to building triceps is arm angle. The shoulder, delts, lats and biceps are very close by. So the angle and movement of the arm will make all the difference.</p>\n\n<p>The movement we want is the same as a bicep curl, but we want the opposite force. With a bicep curl we curl the arm from the elbow down up to the shoulder. And in that curl we want the weight to go up toward the sky - curling against gravity.</p>\n\n<p>The tricep pushdown, whether you use a bar, resistance bands or rope, works by placing the resistance above your head and pushing down. By pushing down you reverse the curl motion and are forced to use the back of the arm, the tricep.</p>\n\n<p>Technique is very important as we stated. Start by pressing your elbows against the side of your torso not allowing them to flare out. Start with your elbows bent at 90 degrees so your forearms are parallel with the floor. Press down on the bar or the rope and extend your elbows until your arms are straight and finish alongside your thighs. Straighten and control your forearms back up to starting position.</p>\n\n<p>Using a rope for a tricep pushdown requires you to use your arm stabilizer muscles as well. As you know from the Full Body Blitz, we really emphasize compound movements. Isolation exercises are great if you are a body builder prepping for a show, otherwise compound movements really stress more muscles at once.  </p>\n\n<h2>Close Grip Basketball Push-ups</h2>  \n\n<p>While you are learning how to build your triceps, you should learn how more than one way to work the muscles.

DO NOT TRAIN ABS EVERYDAY!!</strong>!</em>\nI ALWAYS hear people saying that its ok to train abs everyday, that is pharmaceutical grade bullshit! Abs are just like any other muscle. You wouldn't train legs every day so why would it make sense to train abs every day? I train my abs 2-3 times per week. If your just starting out, you should do even less. As rule of thumb, after you workout a body part, wait till your 100% not sore before you train that body part again.The best exercises to give you abs of steel are the ones that allow you to rest in between.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><em>2. YOU CAN NOT BURN FAT IN ONLY ONE SPOT!!!</em></strong>\nThere is no such thing as spot reduction. If you workout your abs and get them strong, they still may not show if you have a layer of fat on them. People think that just doing ab workouts will help them lose there guts, but it does not work like that. You can't just make it disappear from your waist alone.\n\nWhen you increase your exercise time and moderately cut back on calories, your body will start to burn some of your stored fat for energy. The result is fat loss... everywhere. When you drop enough fat for your six-pack to show.\n\n<em><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">3. YOU HAVE TO EAT RIGHT!!!</strong></em>\nyou cannot out-train a bad diet!!!!! Abs are made in the kitchen and not the gym. Diet is responsible for 90% of your results! In order to burn the fat that is covering up your abs you need a good diet and a solid strength training program backing it up. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Brandon-Carter/15765096041?sk=app_103520946352747\">Here is some FREE info to get your started! </a>\n\nIf you're really looking for the <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/category/ABS\">best exercises to give you abs, then consider your diet an exercise and get it right.</a>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><em>4. DO MORE CARDIO</em></strong>\nI strongly recommend your try HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) cardio. It burns WAY more fat in far less time than traditional cardio. A study at Laval University in Quebec, Canada found that HIIT cardio helped trainees loose nine (yes, 9!) times more fat than those who trained the traditional way (moderate speed for 20-60 minutes). Combine HIIT with your weight program and you boost your metabolism through the roof!\n\n<strong>5. DRINK MORE WATER!!!</strong>\nSince our bodies are over 70% water, drinking water is essential for optimal health. Water helps prime the body for fat loss, as well as flush out harmful toxins. Not drinking enough can lead to a water imbalance in the body, which can increase your risk of disease.

The ideal workout program for losing fat should consist of two key components: adding muscle and burning fat.\n\nA great way to add definition is to do <strong>Isolation Exercises</strong>. I mentioned in another post that <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/more-muscle-in-less-time-multi-joint-exercises/\" target=\"_blank\">Compound Exercises</a> are the best for adding size (and they are the best overall). When it comes to targeting a specific muscle and sculpting your body, however, isolation movements are the go-to exercises.\n\nUntil you're big this is not necessary. In fact, for most people this is not necessary at all unless you're going to enter a bodybuilding competition or something. Isolation will certainly help you master specific muscles, but the compound ones just help you grow in total.\n<h3><strong>What Are Isolation Exercises?</strong></h3>\nAn <strong>isolation exercise</strong> is any exercise in which <em>only one</em> major muscle group is trained by itself. Typically, the movement is done in such a way where usage of all other muscle groups is avoided, which leaves the targeted muscle isolated and able to do all of the work.\n\nHere’s a list of the most common isolation exercises along with the muscle it isolates:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong> </strong></td>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong>Muscle trained</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong> flat, incline, or decline flyes (dumbbell, cable, or machine)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"319\">chest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong> lateral raises or front raises (dumbbell, cable, or machine)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"319\">shoulder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong> bicep curls (barbell, dumbbell, cable, or machine)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"319\"> biceps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong> tricep extensions (barbell, dumbbell, cable, or machine)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"319\"> triceps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong> leg extensions</strong></td>\n<td width=\"319\"> quads</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong> leg curls</strong></td>\n<td width=\"319\"> hamstrings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong> calf raises</strong></td>\n<td width=\"319\"> calf</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><strong>What Are Compound Exercises?</strong></h3>\nA <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/more-muscle-in-less-time-multi-joint-exercises/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>compound exercise</strong></a> is any exercise that involves the use of <em>more than one</em> major muscle group at a time. Typically, there is one larger muscle group that ends up doing the majority of the work and one or more smaller muscle groups that are recruited secondarily.\n\nHere’s a list of the most common compound exercises along with the primary and secondary muscle groups each one targets:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\"><strong> </strong></td>\n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Primary muscle</strong></td>\n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Secondary muscle</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Flat, incline, decline bench press</strong></td>\n<td width=\"213\"> chest</td>\n<td width=\"213\"> shoulder, triceps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Overhead shoulder press</strong></td>\n<td width=\"213\"> shoulders</td>\n<td width=\"213\"> triceps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Dips (with forward lean)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"213\"> chest, shoulders</td>\n<td width=\"213\"> triceps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Rows (barbell or machine)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"213\"> back</td>\n<td width=\"213\"> biceps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Chin-ups, lat pull-downs</strong></td>\n<td width=\"213\"> back</td>\n<td width=\"213\"> biceps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Deadlifts (many variations</strong></td>\n<td width=\"213\"> posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, back, etc.</td>\n<td width=\"213\"> much of upper and lower body</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Squats (many variations)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"213\"> quads</td>\n<td width=\"213\"> much of lower body, back</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><strong>How to Incorporate Both Compound and Isolation Exercises</strong></h3>\nI want to present an analogy to describe what I believe to be a good approach to using both compound and isolation exercises.\n\n<img src=\"http://bodybymitch.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/finished_body.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" align=\"left\" />\n\nThe artists receive their block of clay or stone and decide to make a piece that depicts the human body. The first thing the artist does is decide on the overall shape and dimensions of the body. The artist then carves off large pieces to get  the general shape of the body created. Once the general dimensions are determined, they begin to shape the body parts, focusing progressively on the finer details.\n\nSo the message in this story is that the artists create the sculpture by working out the largest aspects first and moving down to the details or finishing touches last.\n\nSo how does this apply to getting fit and building the physique you want?\n\nCompound exercises relate to the overall shape of the body, whereas isolation exercises relate more to the finishing touches.\n\n<strong><em>Compound Exercises are like the sledgehammer and Isolation Exercises are the chisel</em></strong>\n<h3>What's Next?</h3>\nI personally believe that the majority of your weight room exercises should be compound movements.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Compound exercises should be a major part of your program. In fact, I would say somewhere in the ballpark of 80% compound to 20% isolation is a good ratio. This is hands down the most effective workout program for losing fat and achieving optimal muscle definition.</strong>\n\nFor a comprehensive muscle building and fat loss strategy, be sure to check out <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>If you're like me, you're working on getting more cut up and ripped so you can proudly show off your body at the beach or pool or gym.

Typically, the movement is done in such a way where usage of all other muscle groups is avoided, which leaves the targeted muscle isolated and able to do all of the work.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a list of the most common isolation exercises along with the muscle it isolates:  </p>\n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\"><strong> </strong></td>  \n<td width=\"319\"><strong>Muscle trained</strong></td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\"><strong> flat, incline, or decline flyes (dumbbell, cable, or machine)</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"319\">chest</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\"><strong> lateral raises or front raises (dumbbell, cable, or machine)</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"319\">shoulder</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\"><strong> bicep curls (barbell, dumbbell, cable, or machine)</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"319\"> biceps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\"><strong> tricep extensions (barbell, dumbbell, cable, or machine)</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"319\"> triceps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\"><strong> leg extensions</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"319\"> quads</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\"><strong> leg curls</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"319\"> hamstrings</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\"><strong> calf raises</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"319\"> calf</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<h3><strong>What Are Compound Exercises?</strong></h3>  \n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/more-muscle-in-less-time-multi-joint-exercises/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>compound exercise</strong></a> is any exercise that involves the use of <em>more than one</em> major muscle group at a time. Typically, there is one larger muscle group that ends up doing the majority of the work and one or more smaller muscle groups that are recruited secondarily.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a list of the most common compound exercises along with the primary and secondary muscle groups each one targets:  </p>\n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\"><strong> </strong></td>  \n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Primary muscle</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Secondary muscle</strong></td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Flat, incline, decline bench press</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> chest</td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> shoulder, triceps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Overhead shoulder press</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> shoulders</td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> triceps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Dips (with forward lean)</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> chest, shoulders</td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> triceps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Rows (barbell or machine)</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> back</td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> biceps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Chin-ups, lat pull-downs</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> back</td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> biceps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Deadlifts (many variations</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, back, etc.</td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> much of upper and lower body</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"213\"><strong>Squats (many variations)</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> quads</td>  \n<td width=\"213\"> much of lower body, back</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<h3><strong>How to Incorporate Both Compound and Isolation Exercises</strong></h3>  \n\n<p>I want to present an analogy to describe what I believe to be a good approach to using both compound and isolation exercises.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bodybymitch.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/finished_body.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" align=\"left\" /></p>\n\n<p>The artists receive their block of clay or stone and decide to make a piece that depicts the human body. The first thing the artist does is decide on the overall shape and dimensions of the body. The artist then carves off large pieces to get  the general shape of the body created. Once the general dimensions are determined, they begin to shape the body parts, focusing progressively on the finer details.</p>\n\n<p>So the message in this story is that the artists create the sculpture by working out the largest aspects first and moving down to the details or finishing touches last.</p>\n\n<p>So how does this apply to getting fit and building the physique you want?</p>\n\n<p>Compound exercises relate to the overall shape of the body, whereas isolation exercises relate more to the finishing touches.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Compound Exercises are like the sledgehammer and Isolation Exercises are the chisel</em></strong>  </p>\n\n<h3>What's Next?</h3>  \n\n<p>I personally believe that the majority of your weight room exercises should be compound movements.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Compound exercises should be a major part of your program. In fact, I would say somewhere in the ballpark of 80% compound to 20% isolation is a good ratio. This is hands down the most effective workout program for losing fat and achieving optimal muscle definition.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For a comprehensive muscle building and fat loss strategy, be sure to check out <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>.</p>","amp":null,"image":"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/08/IMG_1077.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-09-05 11:28:25","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-09-05 11:28:25","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-09-05 11:28:25","published_by":1},{"id":2191,"uuid":"3aef07bc-8893-446e-bc49-11b63c3e6509","title":"Bodybuilding Diet on a Budget: How Milk Helps You Gain Muscle Without Breaking the Bank","slug":"bodybuilding-diet-on-a-budget","markdown":"Some of you may have followed a hardgainer’s diet.

I'm so proud of what these exercises have produced I want to show everybody.\nThe thing is I'm not Superman. I eat a good diet and get my exercise in each day, but more than anything it's this - I've been able to discover the best six pack exercises I think could possibly exist. You can't just put any group of crunches together and call them the best six pack exercises. That's just ridiculous.\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1571\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/26163959/insta7-300x300.png\" alt=\"insta7\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />  The abs themselves, they're complicated. It's not like it's just one muscle. You know I talk about doing compound movements a lot because we only have so much time, and unless you're looking to be Mr. Olympia . . you don't really need to do 900 bicep curls to get kick ass biceps.\n<strong>With the abs, to get a six pack you need a few things:</strong>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>1.</strong> Even if you have it you won't be able to see it until you really cut the fat. That takes diet and maybe some good cardio.</li>\n \t<li><strong>2.</strong> You need exercises that hit all the abdominal muscles. Did you know there were upper abs and lower abs? Did you know that was true for obliques, too? Crunches are really only focused on one area. We need to hit 'em all, baby!</li>\n \t<li><strong>3.</strong> Mindset. Abs don't happen overnight.

One of the things I was worried about was doing my chest workout at home. But I don't worry any longer. Other than being disciplined to do it at home, you should be able to get an unbelievable chest from these exercises.\n<h3><strong>Doing Bench Press at Home</strong></h3>\nI'm not gonna lie, the <strong>bench press is the king</strong> of chest exercises. The ability to change weights and ratchet down to get a deep burn . . . nothing can replace that. But there are alternatives, as I described in the video, that are fantastic.\nTo get an overall chest workout, get yourself some <strong>suspension bands or TRX bands</strong> like I show in the video (at :54 seconds), you can really get ripped up using those. Suspend those from a door or frame and you've got chest, stabilizing muscles, abs. . . everything you'd want in a combo exercise.\nIf you can suspend these from above (they come with instructions) then you can put your legs on a chair and your hands in the stirrups of the bands. Then proceed to do push-ups like you'd normally do. Keeping the bands underneath you is a bitch. That's takes serious concentration. The reason the bands are great is because they move. They are not fixed or stable.\nYour arms, your core and your chest have to be working hard while you do that. Similar to the way your arms have to stabilize the bar on bench press, with suspension bands your entire body must stay strong while you're doing the exercise.\n<h3><strong>Lower Chest Exercises</strong></h3>\nThe lower chest are the muscles that grow when you do push-ups. They typically respond the quickest to growth and thus get the most attention.\nWhile push-ups are pretty common place, not many people do them right. So let's go through the mechanics real quick to make sure you're going to get the bang for your buck.\n\n<strong>Step 1 - </strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">From a lying down position with hands just under your shoulders, push-up to straight arms and hold it there. In this position your back and legs should be one straight line to your feet. No sagging or lifting. If someone put a ball on your neck, it should roll easily down your back to your feet.\n<strong>Step 2 -</strong> Through bending your arms lower your entire body to the floor without changing your straight back and legs. Pretend as if your body is a table resting on your arms. As you lower your arms the table would lower.\n<strong>Step 3 -</strong> When you reach the bottom, just above your chest touching the floor lift back up. This is a perfect push-up.\n\nIf you want to add a bit to it, use something like push-up bars or place your hands on books so you'll be able to lower your chest beyond your hands even deeper to get a better stretch. <strong>You can also grab two chairs (1:09 in the video) and do dips</strong>. Most people think dips are for triceps, and they are. But if you lean a little bit forward when you are doing them you'll get a killer chest burn and tricep burn. If your chairs are pretty strong and you need to make it a bit harder, hold a book between your knees or put it in your lap.\n\nThe key to dips is making sure your elbows go straight back. Don't let them flare out to the sides. Slowly dip down and slowly raise. Momentum is always your enemy.\n<h3><strong>Upper Chest Exercises</strong></h3>\n<img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1879\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/15165038/Arnold-schwarzenegger-upper-chest-213x300.jpg\" alt=\"Arnold-schwarzenegger-upper-chest\" width=\"213\" height=\"300\" /> The upper chest is the holy grail of chest muscles. While most fit guys have a great lower chest, you only have to look at Schwarzenegger once to know that his upper chest muscles are just as powerful as his lower chest muscles. If you want to work your upper chest muscles specifically, you have to make some slight adjustments to the exercises.\nIn the gym the best way to target the <strong>upper chest is with incline press</strong>. We can replicate that at home by getting into the push-up position then raising our legs a bit, perhaps setting them on that chair. The higher we can raise our legs the more we steepen the incline.\nAnd yes, you can raise them too high. Once you get past 30 degrees the shoulder muscles take on a much stronger role. You'll reduce the focus on the upper chest once that happens, so don't go too high.\nTo make it a bit harder you can do one of two things. If you have a hard surface you can put cloth under your hands and then slide them together as you lower. This would simulate the dumbbell press on the incline bench where you bring your hands together at the top. Or if you are on carpet you can step one hand into the other as you lower down to the floor and step back out as you push up.\n<h3><strong>Dumbbell Fly at Home?</strong></h3>\nTo hit the other heads of the pec muscles do a \"floor fly\" instead of a dumbbell fly (2:27). A dumbbell fly (or pec fly) is really a wide push up that brings your hands together at the end. The dumbbell fly works the entire pectoral muscle but from a different angle.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1880\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/15165038/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-3.03.48-PM-300x170.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-15 at 3.03.48 PM\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" />\n\nWith the floor fly you still get to start wide and end narrow, but make sure you are squeezing your chest muscles together the entire time.\n<h3><strong>Developing Fast Twitch Muscles</strong></h3>\nFast twitch muscles come into play when your body does explosive or fast movements. They play a big role in muscle growth as well. If you're looking to increase your power, developing the fast twitch muscles is important.\n\nAs it pertains to doing your chest exercises at home, add a component -<strong> go explosive!</strong> Again get in the push-up position. Lower your body to the ground then push up fast exploding off the ground, clap in the air and then catch and lower yourself down. You can see that in action at 1:44 in the video above. Plyometrics really knock it up a notch.\n\nAdding explosive movements to all your exercises will aid in fat loss, muscle growth and overall power.

The higher we can raise our legs the more we steepen the incline. <br />\nAnd yes, you can raise them too high. Once you get past 30 degrees the shoulder muscles take on a much stronger role. You'll reduce the focus on the upper chest once that happens, so don't go too high. <br />\nTo make it a bit harder you can do one of two things. If you have a hard surface you can put cloth under your hands and then slide them together as you lower. This would simulate the dumbbell press on the incline bench where you bring your hands together at the top. Or if you are on carpet you can step one hand into the other as you lower down to the floor and step back out as you push up.  </p>\n\n<h3><strong>Dumbbell Fly at Home?</strong></h3>  \n\n<p>To hit the other heads of the pec muscles do a \"floor fly\" instead of a dumbbell fly (2:27). A dumbbell fly (or pec fly) is really a wide push up that brings your hands together at the end. The dumbbell fly works the entire pectoral muscle but from a different angle.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1880\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/15165038/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-3.03.48-PM-300x170.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-15 at 3.03.48 PM\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" /></p>\n\n<p>With the floor fly you still get to start wide and end narrow, but make sure you are squeezing your chest muscles together the entire time.  </p>\n\n<h3><strong>Developing Fast Twitch Muscles</strong></h3>  \n\n<p>Fast twitch muscles come into play when your body does explosive or fast movements. They play a big role in muscle growth as well. If you're looking to increase your power, developing the fast twitch muscles is important.</p>\n\n<p>As it pertains to doing your chest exercises at home, add a component -<strong> go explosive!</strong> Again get in the push-up position. Lower your body to the ground then push up fast exploding off the ground, clap in the air and then catch and lower yourself down. You can see that in action at 1:44 in the video above. Plyometrics really knock it up a notch.</p>\n\n<p>Adding explosive movements to all your exercises will aid in fat loss, muscle growth and overall power.

Yes you may put on some fat with it, but you can take that fat off with a mix of cardio and HIIT training.\n\nNow, the only real way to build mass is to consume more calories than you burn (to a point). If you're not comfortable with that, then you probably need to go into a fat loss period before you begin building muscle. Because once you start the building phase you're going to have to eat more and sometimes that means you also put on a little fat.\n\nJust like one of the more recent case studies I got:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1907\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/15165038/mem-d.png\" alt=\"mem-d\" width=\"580\" height=\"593\" />.</p><p>\nYou can avoid that as well if you add cardio to your regiment - just know that your muscles need to be fed to grow.\n\n<strong>Here are the foods I want you to focus on for building mass</strong> - and staying in a moderate calorie surplus that's conducive to adding muscle with minimal fat gain:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: white;\" valign=\"top\">\n<h3>Milk</h3>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1911\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/23135111/milk-body-building-food-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"milk-body-building-food\" width=\"300\" /></td>\n<td style=\"background-color: white;\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Muscle Building Components:</strong>Protein, calcium, magnesium and phosphoros\n\n<strong>Brandon's Take:</strong> If your stomach can handle milk, I’m all for it if you’re trying to build muscle. Normally I don’t recommend people drink milk, but if gaining muscle or strength is your goal, there’s no denying that milk works incredibly well. I have seen people drink 1/2 gallon of milk per day in addition to regular diet and they have put on as much as 15+ lbs (&amp; got much stronger) over the course of 2 months… If you’re really skinny you can even try a gallon of milk per day.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<h3>Grass-fed Beef</h3>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1917\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/23135111/beef-body-building-foods-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"beef-body-building-foods\" width=\"300\" /></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Muscle Building Components:</strong> 27 grams of protein per 100 grams of beef. Zinc for testosterone production, Vitamin B12, Conjugated Linoleic Acid\n\n<strong>Brandon's Take:</strong> Some of the best protein sources you’ll find come from good cuts of meat. I recommend steaks, ground beef and pork for trying to put on some muscle. As much as I’m not a fan of WalMart you can usually find some cheap stakes that taste pretty good for $4-$5. I know you can't always find or afford grass-fed but when you have the chance, please take advantage.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: white;\" valign=\"top\">\n<h3>Spinach</h3>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1910\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/23135111/spinach-body-building-food.jpg\" alt=\"spinach-body-building-food\" width=\"300\" /></td>\n<td style=\"background-color: white;\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Muscle Building Components:</strong>Glutamine for muscle growth, calcium, protein, iron and vitamins\n\n<strong>Brandon's Take:</strong>Spinach is the most alkaline of the vegetables. Keeping your body in an alkaline state helps you sleep better which is part of the muscle building period. I love that Popeye ate it for big muscles but really it is dense in vitamins and minerals, low in calories and versatile in cooking.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<h3>Apples</h3>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1909\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/23135111/apple-body-buiding-food-300x206.jpg\" alt=\"apple-body-buiding-food\" width=\"300\" /></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Muscle Building Components:</strong>Antioxidants and fiber.\n\n<strong>Brandon's Take:</strong>Fiber is great for the diet. Part of a healthy system is elimination so we need to make sure we keep a healthy system. Apples are full of antioxidants as well, which our cells need to function.

While the science of muscle building can get quite complex, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand how muscle tissue grows. Having a layman's understanding will give you a better idea of why certain exercises and training regimens are better than others.\n\nHere are five muscle building tips and the scientific explanation behind them.\n<h3><strong>Muscle Building Tip #1: Hit Multiple Joints </strong></h3>\nBuilding muscle quickly will not work doing single joint movements like bicep curls or tricep extensions unless you are already very muscular. Multi-joint exercises like pull-ups, squats, bench presses, and deadlifts will do the job. These exercises will not only work muscles in less time, but will also allow you to use much heavier weight than you would with single-joint exercises. g\n\nMuscle building is all about testosterone, and compound movements are shown to create optimal testosterone surge in the testes. In this <a href=\"http://iamdentistry.com/archive/general-health/why-should-you-focus-on-compound-exercises/\">study</a>, athletes were divided into two weight training groups. Group 1 performed only compound exercises, while group 2 did compound exercises plus bicep curls. At the conclusion of the 10-week study, both groups gained roughly the same amount of muscle. Group 2, despite performing the additional isolation curls, did not have an average larger arm circumference than group 1.\n<h3><strong>Muscle Building Tip #2: Get Heavy</strong></h3>\nA lot of people that try to build muscle do not employ heavy volume training, that is, heavy weights with low repetition (typically within 3-6 rep range). Pick heavy weights and <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/how-many-reps-should-you-do-2/\" target=\"_blank\">go to failure for each set. </a>\n\nWhile the studies are not completely conclusive, most researchers and trainers alike agree that heavy volume is the best course for optimal strength and muscle gains.\n\nRemember that the keyword here is \"muscle failure.\" This means you absolutely cannot perform another rep even if I put a gun to your head. One of the reasons bodybuilders have a partner is so there is someone there to help them when the weight gets too heavy to lift with good form. If you don't have a workout partner, just stop when you get too tired to lift with good form, rest a few seconds, then keep lifting to complete the set.\n\nThis is much better than using a weight that allows you to comfortably complete a set without muscle failure.\n<h3><strong>Muscle Building Tip #3: Do Less Cardio</strong></h3>\nYour body needs calories in order to build muscle, so if you're doing a significant amount of cardio like bicycling or running, you're burning calories that your body could otherwise use for muscle building. If you want to build muscle as fast as possible, limit your cardio to a brief 2-3 sessions of <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/extreme-cardio-training/\">HIIT CARDIO</a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOupwDJ1eIA\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>Muscle Building Tip #4: Eat</strong></h3>\nTo put on  muscle, you have to push your muscles slightly beyond what they are capable of doing. When you do this tiny tears occur in the muscles . . . this is the beginning of muscle growth. And this is why food is important. We want the body to fill these tears with muscle created by consuming calories. Each fill grows the muscle.\n\nSo you must consume more calories than you burn. Instead of shoving anything down your throat, try to grab calories from healthy protein sources like grass-fed beef, healthy fat sources like coconut milk, avocados, and healthy carbohydrate sources like potatoes and yams. You should be eating 6-7 meals a day, or eating every three hours.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://vancouverhealthcoach.com/2011/07/does-total-calories-lead-to-muscle-growth-or-is-it-about-protein/\">study </a>reveals the necessity for eating more calories when trying to gain lean mass.

If you work a muscle too hard for too many days in a row, those muscle fibers will become too damaged to properly repair and grow. Typically, a muscle needs at least 72 hours to properly repair from a workout. A good rule to follow is to wait until you are no longer sore in a muscle before working it again. For example, do a shoulders and chest workout on Wednesday and Saturday, a leg workout on Tuesday and Friday, and a back, arms, and abs workout on Monday and Thursday.\nRead this<a href=\"http://www.criticalbench.com/strength_training_muscle_recovery.htm\"> report</a> on the importance of resting and the scientific study behind it.\n\nAre you fed up with the excuses and ready to commit to a program that delivers results?

There is a body weight book that is better than this. It's written by an old school gymnastics instructor. And this guy describes in detail all the moves. Ya know the playground stuff we're doing on the bars is really just street gymnastics.\n\nBut this book shows every move, shows the sequence in learning it in fact. You need this book, for real. There's going to be a time you want to know how to do something and you're not going to be able to find a tutorial on YouTube. But it's in here.\n<h3>The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding: Arnold Schwarzenegger</h3>\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Fx4lA8\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1468 size-full\" src=\"https://highlifeworkout.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/arnold.jpg\" alt=\"Top 10 Ten Books for Health, Wealth, and Success\" width=\"260\" height=\"331\" /></a>\n\nIf you're into bodybuilding, not necessarily bodyweight training, this is the bible for that. This book is full of workouts, programs, nutrition. . . man oh man like everything. It may seem too intense for guys who don't juice, or aren't serious bodybuilders. I've not done them but it would be a good program. Basically every exercise is in here. Like everyone and how to do them correctly.\n\nIt's an encyclopedia, so it's not like you have to read it from cover to cover. You can just take pieces of them, you don't have to do them all. If you've plateau'd or are super serious, you need this book. That's why it is in my top 10.\n<h3>Mean Genes: By Terry Burnham</h3>\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1GSnKtx\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1469 size-full\" src=\"https://highlifeworkout.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/fdaf.jpg\" alt=\"Top 10 Ten Books for Health, Wealth, and Success\" width=\"260\" /></a>\n\nMean Genes was written by two Harvard professors. In this book they explain everything about life. And they explain it from an evolutionary perspective. Questions like:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Why we make the decisions we make.</li>\n \t<li>Why you can't stop eating sweets.</li>\n \t<li>Why people cheat.</li>\n \t<li>Why some people succeed and others don't.</li>\n \t<li>If you don't believe in evolution. . . you're screwed.</li>\n \t<li>Why do women live longer.</li>\n \t<li>Why do we find certain people attractive.</li>\n \t<li>Why do we like taking risks.</li>\n</ul>\nBasically explains . . it is the owner's manual to your mind and body.\n<h3>Rich Dad Poor Dad: Robert T. Kiyosaki</h3>\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1HXUq5S\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1470 size-full\" src=\"https://highlifeworkout.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/rich-dad-por-dad.jpg\" alt=\"Top 10 Ten Books for Health, Wealth, and Success\" width=\"260\" /></a>\n\nThis book really impacted me when I was younger. Even though it's one of the best books I ever read, I don't agree with every word. Like I don't agree that college is bullshit, but that's ok. If it weren't for college, I'd still be in the hood. Kiyosaki explains a lot about business.\n\nSome people say they have a business but really they have a job. If you have to be there, it's a job. I'd love for you to read that and let it sink in, really sink in. If you have to be there, it's a job. The most important takeaway from this book is the takeaway that is going to change your life forever. The difference between a job and a business will have you looking at what you do in a whole new light.\n<h3>Maximum Achievement: By Brian Tracy</h3>\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1EZZCYx\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1471 size-full\" src=\"https://highlifeworkout.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/brian-tracy.jpg\" alt=\"Top 10 Ten Books for Health, Wealth, and Success\" width=\"260\" /></a>\n\nThis book is going to show you how to be successful. Success isn't a mindset. It's way more than that and is a lot about execution. If you can execute the tasks you need to get done in order to be successful you'll be far ahead of the pack.\n\nBrian Tracy answers questions like \"how to set goals how to make plans\", \"How to achieve your goals\", \"how to navigate the terrain to a goal, any goal, relationship or money\".\n\nBrian Tracy has written many books. Many of those are on success. This one is his best. Maximum Achievement is about success.\n<h3>Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength by Roy F. Baumeister</h3>\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1F00k8q\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1472 size-full\" src=\"https://highlifeworkout.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/willpower.jpg\" alt=\"Top 10 Ten Books for Health, Wealth, and Success\" width=\"260\" /></a>\n\nIf you have any problem or issues like laziness, aren't motivated, just don't have the will power to get shit done, or discipline, for instance, this book will help you. I don't say that jokingly. If you're the kind of person that would really like to be better and know you have \"shiny button syndrome\" or are easily distracted, you need this book.\n\nFirst of all it will tell you why. It will tell you how what you affects who you are and what you do. There are tons of scientific studies backing this stuff up.\n\nIt's about discipline. This book tells you how to build discipline. Without discipline you can't accomplish anything.\n<h3>Meditations: by Marcus Aurelius</h3>\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1xbZItV\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1473 size-full\" src=\"https://highlifeworkout.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/meditations.jpg\" alt=\"Top 10 Ten Books for Health, Wealth, and Success\" width=\"260\" /></a>\n\nThis dude, Marcus Aurelius, was an emperor. A Roman emperor. This dude was the real deal. He was the first pragmatic.\n\nBasically, Marcus says crying doesn't help. Learn to accept the bad shit and move forward. Accept the fact that people are going to hurt you.\n\nUntil you accept that there is good and bad in the world and you have the power to react to it as you will, you can not grow. You can not move forward.\n\nMeditations is about gaining control because crying doesn't help. Learn to accept what you have, learn to manage what you have with success. Instead of reacting to it. This book is about changing your stake in life. This book taught me you can feel how you want to feel regardless of circumstances.\n\nYou can't control outside circumstances.\n\nIf your emotions control you, are you really in charge?\n<h3>Awakening The Giant Within: Tony Robbins</h3>\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1LpA1fJ\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1480\" src=\"https://highlifeworkout.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/tony-tone.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Robbins\" width=\"260\" /></a>\n\nTony Robbins is the \"ultimate coach\" for people who will always strive to be better.\n\nI can't say enough good about what he communicates. The problem is he's so flamboyant that it's easy for people to \"shit\" on him.\n\nThe crazy thing is most people who say bad things haven't read his material. Not one page.\n\nLet me tell you, this book changed my life, it made me a happier person. Tony Robbins is the \"ultimate coach\" for that special breed of men and women who will never settle for less than they can be.\n\nTony gave me the strength to take ACTION by showing me that past events did not determine future events. He also gave me the tools to chart a new destiny for myself and create a life full of passion.\n<h3>The 48 Laws of Power: by Robert Greene</h3>\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1MHDX8O\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1474 size-full\" src=\"https://highlifeworkout.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/power.jpg\" alt=\"Top 10 Ten Books for Health, Wealth, and Success\" width=\"260\" /></a>\n\nThis book is hard to read because what Robert Greene espouses is a life without morals. These 48 Laws take into account no consequences for what you do to get power.\n\nI like it because the laws are raw. You should apply your own morals and values to determine how to make these laws work for you. But the bottom line is this kind of candid discussion about how power works can't found anywhere else.\n\nWhether you're trying to take over the world, take over a company or take over your own health and wellness, this is a great discussion on power.\n\n1.\n<h3>How to Win Friends and Influence People: by Dale Carnegie</h3>\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1LpCiHJ\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1475 size-full\" src=\"https://highlifeworkout.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/dsfs.jpg\" alt=\"Top 10 Ten Books for Health, Wealth, and Success\" width=\"214\" height=\"346\" /></a>\n\nWarren Buffet, Tony Robbins and a host of other amazing business leaders have taken Dale Carnegie courses. And all have spoken highly because what he teaches is amazing.\n\nI wish school taught these 30 principles to every kid, over and over, until they were ingrained. Let's talk about a few that are going to help you in your fitness life:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Love every improvement, no matter how small</li>\n \t<li>Begin in a friendly way</li>\n \t<li>Throw down a challenge</li>\n \t<li>Appeal to the nobler motives</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>So What's Next?</h3>\nGet these books and read them. And know no matter how badly you want to lose weight, get fit or get a six pack you're not going to do it till you get your mind right. That means nutrition, motivation, motives and priorities.\n\nI want you to start that today by <a href=\"http://big.brandoncarter.com/fat-loss-survey\" target=\"new\">taking our survey</a> to figure out exactly where you should start.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>For a long time, people have been asking me to put together a list of my top 10 favorite books. I read it least two books per week and I had been doing that for a number of years.

Tony Robbins is the \"ultimate coach\" for that special breed of men and women who will never settle for less than they can be.</p>\n\n<p>Tony gave me the strength to take ACTION by showing me that past events did not determine future events. He also gave me the tools to chart a new destiny for myself and create a life full of passion.  </p>\n\n<h3>The 48 Laws of Power: by Robert Greene</h3>  \n\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1MHDX8O\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1474 size-full\" src=\"https://highlifeworkout.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/power.jpg\" alt=\"Top 10 Ten Books for Health, Wealth, and Success\" width=\"260\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This book is hard to read because what Robert Greene espouses is a life without morals. These 48 Laws take into account no consequences for what you do to get power.</p>\n\n<p>I like it because the laws are raw. You should apply your own morals and values to determine how to make these laws work for you. But the bottom line is this kind of candid discussion about how power works can't found anywhere else.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you're trying to take over the world, take over a company or take over your own health and wellness, this is a great discussion on power.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><h3>How to Win Friends and Influence People: by Dale Carnegie</h3>  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1LpCiHJ\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1475 size-full\" src=\"https://highlifeworkout.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/dsfs.jpg\" alt=\"Top 10 Ten Books for Health, Wealth, and Success\" width=\"214\" height=\"346\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Warren Buffet, Tony Robbins and a host of other amazing business leaders have taken Dale Carnegie courses. And all have spoken highly because what he teaches is amazing.</p>\n\n<p>I wish school taught these 30 principles to every kid, over and over, until they were ingrained. Let's talk about a few that are going to help you in your fitness life:  </p>\n\n<ol>  \n     <li>Love every improvement, no matter how small</li>\n     <li>Begin in a friendly way</li>\n     <li>Throw down a challenge</li>\n     <li>Appeal to the nobler motives</li>\n</ol>  \n\n<h3>So What's Next?</h3>  \n\n<p>Get these books and read them. And know no matter how badly you want to lose weight, get fit or get a six pack you're not going to do it till you get your mind right.

ripped abs cannot be obtained by doing endless repetitions of sit-ups and crunches. You have to lose the body fat around your midsection, and that is obtained through a combination of weight training, aerobics, and healthy dieting. Nevertheless, you should still make ab exercises a regular part of your routine for the sake of keeping your core strong. You don’t need bulky equipment to give your abs a killer workout. In fact, there are plenty of six pack exercises you can do at home using little to no equipment.\n<h3>1. Russian Twist</h3>\nThis works out your upper and lower abs as well as your oblique. Position your body so that only your buttock is touching the floor. Bend your knees and cross your legs. Hold a dumbbell, kettlebell, or medicine ball in your hands and swivel your body to the left and right. Your feet and back should not touch the floor at any point in this exercise. Use enough weight to reach muscle failure within 15 reps or less.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DYuSXvpu0g\n<h3>2. Ab Wheel</h3>\nAn ab wheel can be purchased at your local sporting goods store for $10. It’s a whole new way of strengthening your core without lying on your back. Once you get good at it, it will become as easy as sit-ups. When you reach this level, increase the intensity by performing the reps while standing. Being able to do even just one rep standing is a true feat of abdominal strength. You can slowly build up to it, though, by doing partial reps and extending the range of motion as you get stronger.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RazOrhbndPY\n<h3>3. Abdominal Hold</h3>\nHere’s an exercise that focuses on isometrics rather than repetitions. Sit on a chair with your butt at the edge. With your hands on the edge of the seat and the fingers pointing outward, lift your buttocks off the chair with your thighs parallel with the floor or higher. Hold for as long as you can; this comprises of one set. Rest for one minute before beginning the next set.\n\nNote: During the exercise, keep your back as straight as possible because it will be tempted to hunch over to relieve some of the pressure on your abs.\n<h3>4. Leaning Camel</h3>\nHere’s an unconventional ab exercise with an equally unconventional name. Get on your knees and hold a dumbbell, kettlebell, or medicine ball. Keeping your spine straight the whole time, slowly lean back until you feel like you’re going to fall over. Tighten your glutes and abdominals to propel your body back to the starting position.\n<h3>5. Janda Sit-Up</h3>\nYeah, I know, it says in the title that the exercises would not include sit-ups. Janda sit-ups, though, can be best described as sit-ups 2.0 and is worth a mention due to the added resistance. For the most part, the exercise is done like a regular sit-up. Here’s the twist: you’re going to have a partner place his knees on your feet while also grabbing your ankles and pulling them away from you. This takes away momentum from the hip flexors, thus forcing your abdominals to do all the work. If a partner isn’t available, you can also place resistance bands over your calves as demonstrated in the video.\n\nTo make the exercise even more challenging, do the exercise with your feet on the floor while your back is elevated several inches on a plank or aerobic stepper.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkLo47Rgasc&spfreload=10\n<h3>Try Them Out</h3>\nSit-ups are lame, and being able to whip out a thousand reps – while impressive – will not strengthen your core the way you can from adding resistance. These six pack exercises to do at home will target your midsection from different angles and keep your routine from becoming repetitive.\n\nFinally, and I know I’m beginning to sound like a broken record, but it’s worth reiterating: abs of steel is achieved not through ab exercises but through a combination of cardio (think HIIT) and a healthy diet. It is important that you <a href=\"http://brolabsmealplan.com/\">customize a meal plan</a> suitable for your body type and particular fitness goal.\n<h3>So Now What?</h3>\nCheck out my program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a> for more information about burning fat and building muscles.\n\n&nbsp;","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/04102541/IMG_1557.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1615\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/04102541/IMG_1557-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1557\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As you have read in my previous posts, ripped abs cannot be obtained by doing endless repetitions of sit-ups and crunches. You have to lose the body fat around your midsection, and that is obtained through a combination of weight training, aerobics, and healthy dieting. Nevertheless, you should still make ab exercises a regular part of your routine for the sake of keeping your core strong. You don’t need bulky equipment to give your abs a killer workout. In fact, there are plenty of six pack exercises you can do at home using little to no equipment.  </p>\n\n<h3>1. Russian Twist</h3>  \n\n<p>This works out your upper and lower abs as well as your oblique. Position your body so that only your buttock is touching the floor. Bend your knees and cross your legs. Hold a dumbbell, kettlebell, or medicine ball in your hands and swivel your body to the left and right. Your feet and back should not touch the floor at any point in this exercise. Use enough weight to reach muscle failure within 15 reps or less.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DYuSXvpu0g\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DYuSXvpu0g</a>  </p>\n\n<h3>2. Ab Wheel</h3>  \n\n<p>An ab wheel can be purchased at your local sporting goods store for $10. It’s a whole new way of strengthening your core without lying on your back. Once you get good at it, it will become as easy as sit-ups. When you reach this level, increase the intensity by performing the reps while standing. Being able to do even just one rep standing is a true feat of abdominal strength. You can slowly build up to it, though, by doing partial reps and extending the range of motion as you get stronger.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RazOrhbndPY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RazOrhbndPY</a>  </p>\n\n<h3>3.

This means using the latest ab machine promoted in those Saturday morning infomercials isn’t going to get you that washboard abs. You need a consistent routine consisting of dieting, strength training, and cardio.\n<h3>It’s All About Fat Loss</h3>\nYour abs will never show unless you get rid of that stubborn body fat. To turn your body into a fat burning furnace, you need to perform intense cardio 3-6 times a week. This should be done either first thing in the morning (before breakfast) or immediately after your strength training workout.\n\nI recommend doing HIIT because it has just the right intensity level and takes no more than 15-20 minutes of your time. This means that time-wise, there is absolutely no excuse for skipping out on your workout. If you don’t have 15-20 minutes to spare, then I suggest you reevaluate your lifestyle.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE8iQx8O_tg\n<h3>Strength Training</h3>\nWomen typically shun strength training because they fear that the muscle gains will give them a Hulk-like appearance. First of all, this assertion is completely unfounded.

Muscle mass requires energy to maintain, and energy requires calorie expenditure.\n\nA strength training routine consists of the same workouts I have recommended in previous posts. This includes the same number of sets and rep range. Many women who lift weights stick to pink dumbbells and perform upwards of 50 reps in the name of “muscle toning.” Muscle toning is a myth; you get your muscles to show by growing them and stripping the fat that’s covering them up.\n\nHere’s a strength training routine to follow that contains a mix of both compound and isolation movements:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Squats or lunges</td>\n<td width=\"319\">3 sets, 5-10 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Bench or dumbbell presses</td>\n<td width=\"319\">3 sets, 5-10 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Pullups or cable rows</td>\n<td width=\"319\">3 sets, 5-10 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Bicep or dumbbell curls</td>\n<td width=\"319\">3 sets, 5-10 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Tricep pulldowns or skullcrushers</td>\n<td width=\"319\">3 sets, 5-10 reps</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThis is just a sample; feel free to swap out the exercises as long as the replacement works the same muscles and is also a compound/isolation exercise. In other words, don’t replace squats with, say, leg extensions. Men and women alike are tempted to do this from time to time because leg extensions are far less excruciating.\n<h3>Dieting</h3>\nDon’t sacrifice your hard work in the gym by indulging on that chocolate cake. Your diet needs to be spot on and primed for fat burning. Consume a ratio of about 50% protein, 30% carbs, and 20% fat.\n\nAccording to health consensus, women need about 2,000 calories a day. Since your goal is fat loss, you need to consume a bit less than that amount. 1,200 to 1,500 calories is a good figure to shoot for.\n\nHere’s a sample daily diet plan\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">8:00 am</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 cup orange juice, 1 cup skim milk, ½ cup oatmeal</td>\n<td width=\"213\">400 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">11:00 am</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 fruit, ½ cup nuts, string cheese</td>\n<td width=\"213\">300 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">3:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Tuna or turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread</td>\n<td width=\"213\">300 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">6:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Brown rice, chicken breast, steamed vegetables</td>\n<td width=\"213\">300 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">9:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 cup milk</td>\n<td width=\"213\">100 calories</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nYou don’t have to eat like this every day. In fact, you shouldn’t eat like this on a daily basis. Designate one day out of the week as a cheat day. On this day, eat at your heart’s delight and consume around 1,800-2,300 calories. A cheat day not only fights off the cravings but also keeps your body “guessing.” This prevents your body from lowering its metabolism to adjust to the calorie deficit.\n\nOn the subject of diet, I can <a href=\"http://brolabsmealplan.com/\">customize a meal plan</a> for you. Let me configure a dietary lifestyle consistent with your fitness goals.\n<h3>Ab Exercises Do NOT Equal Six Pack Abs</h3>\nSix pack abs for women is not acquired lying down on the floor and doing sit-ups. Far less women would be out of shape if that were the case. If you really desire for a sexy body worthy of that bikini set you saw at the mall, then you have to put in the work, and the work does not entail endless crunches.

The “burn” comes from the buildup of lactic acid entering your muscles. It is also what ultimately causes muscle failure. It only makes sense then that reduction in lactic acid results in better output in the gym. Well, as it turns out, there is actually a specific amino acid called beta-alanine that has been shown to “shield” the body from excess lactate production during a gut-busting workout.\n<h3>Beta-Alanine Explained</h3>\n<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2488\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20222654/15683133156_af2b33104e_b-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"15683133156_af2b33104e_b\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" />\n\nBeta-alanine is a non-essential amino acid, meaning that it’s produced naturally by the body and does not need to be acquired from food. Being non-essential in this sense, however, does not make beta-alanine any less important. In fact, it’s a vital nutrient if you desire peak athletic performance.\n\nI won’t bore you with a scientific explanation. After all, I’m sure you don’t care about all that; you just want to know why it works. If you do care for the scientific end of this valuable amino acid, then I recommend you read the literature at this <a href=\"http://examine.com/supplements/beta-alanine/\">site</a>.\n\nHere’s the meat and potatoes regarding beta-alanine: it is essential in the production of carnosine.\n<h3>What Is Carnosine?</h3>\nCarnosine is another form of amino acid known to have a range of health and anti-aging benefits. In one <a href=\"http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2011/1/Carnosine-Exceeding-Scientific-Expectations/Page-01\">study</a>, injecting carnosine into male fruit flies extended its lifespan by 20%. It also increased the lifespan of the female flies by 36% when combined with vitamin E.\n\nOkay, that’s great but how does carnosine benefit you in the gym? Well, carnosine is found abundantly in the skeletal muscles and particularly in the fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are recruited when performing explosive physical movements like weightlifting or sprinting.\n\nWhen lifting weights, the muscles respond to the stress by producing lactate and lowering the pH. As you may remember in your science class, lower pH means more acidity, hence the burn you feel. Carnosine helps by preventing enzymatic reactions that cause the increased acidic environment. Feeling less muscle burn translates to enhanced anaerobic endurance, a claim that has been verified in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407982/\">study</a>.\n\nYou can watch this video for a more in-depth explanation of carnosine as explained by a doctor of medicine. It's a bit boring to sit through, but it lends credibility to what clinical studies have shown.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSaUogJ2x0\n<h3>Why You Need to Supplement With Beta-Alanine</h3>\nIf carnosine is the amino acid that reduces the muscle burn, then can’t I just supplement with carnosine? Taking carnosine in pill form won’t do you any good because the amino acid is broken down when it enters the digestive tracts. It no longer has its original molecular structure by the time it reaches your muscles.\n\nBeta-alanine, on the other hand, has been proven in studies to increase muscle carnosine levels. The proof is right <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479615\">here</a>.\n<h3>Reach True Muscle Failure With Beta-Alanine</h3>\nIf you’ve been following me for some time, then you know how much I emphasize the importance of reaching absolute muscle failure for gains in lean mass. It has been proven that beta-alanine may delay fatigue just enough for you to get in that extra rep or two even when the muscle burn hits its peak.\n\nFor a supplement that will give a much needed rush of energy and reduce muscle burn, I suggest you try <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\">Rebellion</a>. It has all the ingredients needed – beta-alanine included – to help you train at your maximum output every time you hit the weights or do a cardio workout.\n\n[photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cadencrawford/15683133156/in/photostream/\">Caden Crawford</a>]","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2553\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/26145914/handstand-brandon.png\" alt=\"handstand-brandon\" width=\"330\" height=\"461\" /></p>\n\n<p>Being the health enthusiast that you are, I’m sure you are more than familiar with the feeling of burning muscles during an exercise set.

Well, as it turns out, there is actually a specific amino acid called beta-alanine that has been shown to “shield” the body from excess lactate production during a gut-busting workout.  </p>\n\n<h3>Beta-Alanine Explained</h3>  \n\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2488\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20222654/15683133156_af2b33104e_b-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"15683133156_af2b33104e_b\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n\n<p>Beta-alanine is a non-essential amino acid, meaning that it’s produced naturally by the body and does not need to be acquired from food. Being non-essential in this sense, however, does not make beta-alanine any less important. In fact, it’s a vital nutrient if you desire peak athletic performance.</p>\n\n<p>I won’t bore you with a scientific explanation. After all, I’m sure you don’t care about all that; you just want to know why it works. If you do care for the scientific end of this valuable amino acid, then I recommend you read the literature at this <a href=\"http://examine.com/supplements/beta-alanine/\">site</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the meat and potatoes regarding beta-alanine: it is essential in the production of carnosine.  </p>\n\n<h3>What Is Carnosine?</h3>  \n\n<p>Carnosine is another form of amino acid known to have a range of health and anti-aging benefits. In one <a href=\"http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2011/1/Carnosine-Exceeding-Scientific-Expectations/Page-01\">study</a>, injecting carnosine into male fruit flies extended its lifespan by 20%. It also increased the lifespan of the female flies by 36% when combined with vitamin E.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, that’s great but how does carnosine benefit you in the gym? Well, carnosine is found abundantly in the skeletal muscles and particularly in the fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are recruited when performing explosive physical movements like weightlifting or sprinting.</p>\n\n<p>When lifting weights, the muscles respond to the stress by producing lactate and lowering the pH. As you may remember in your science class, lower pH means more acidity, hence the burn you feel. Carnosine helps by preventing enzymatic reactions that cause the increased acidic environment. Feeling less muscle burn translates to enhanced anaerobic endurance, a claim that has been verified in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407982/\">study</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can watch this video for a more in-depth explanation of carnosine as explained by a doctor of medicine. It's a bit boring to sit through, but it lends credibility to what clinical studies have shown.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSaUogJ2x0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSaUogJ2x0</a>  </p>\n\n<h3>Why You Need to Supplement With Beta-Alanine</h3>  \n\n<p>If carnosine is the amino acid that reduces the muscle burn, then can’t I just supplement with carnosine? Taking carnosine in pill form won’t do you any good because the amino acid is broken down when it enters the digestive tracts. It no longer has its original molecular structure by the time it reaches your muscles.</p>\n\n<p>Beta-alanine, on the other hand, has been proven in studies to increase muscle carnosine levels. The proof is right <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479615\">here</a>.  </p>\n\n<h3>Reach True Muscle Failure With Beta-Alanine</h3>  \n\n<p>If you’ve been following me for some time, then you know how much I emphasize the importance of reaching absolute muscle failure for gains in lean mass. It has been proven that beta-alanine may delay fatigue just enough for you to get in that extra rep or two even when the muscle burn hits its peak.</p>\n\n<p>For a supplement that will give a much needed rush of energy and reduce muscle burn, I suggest you try <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\">Rebellion</a>. It has all the ingredients needed – beta-alanine included – to help you train at your maximum output every time you hit the weights or do a cardio workout.</p>\n\n<p>[photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cadencrawford/15683133156/in/photostream/\">Caden Crawford</a>]</p>","amp":null,"image":"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/12/IMG_1743-1.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-10-26 18:59:56","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-10-26 18:59:56","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-10-26 18:59:56","published_by":1},{"id":2220,"uuid":"4f56d95f-a1a7-46d6-bb77-db73d5268fcd","title":"Foods to Eat for Six-Pack Abs","slug":"foods-to-eat-for-six-pack-abs","markdown":"&nbsp;\n<h3>No Way Around It</h3>\nAt this point, it doesn’t need to be reiterated to you that chiseled abs are acquired through cardio, weight training, and dieting.

Having discipline in the gym but none in the kitchen is a recipe for disaster. You have to eat the right foods for six-pack abs; there is no way around it.\n<h3>Junk Food in Moderation</h3>\nYou know through common sense what junk food consists of. Potato chips, chocolate chip cookies, hotdogs, and soda pop should be saved for your cheat day.

Typically, for fat loss and six pack abs, this includes something along the lines of 50% protein, 25% carbs, and 25% fat.

Having a strong core, after all, is essential for functional strength. Let me show you a few awesome workouts for developing six pack  abs that are as functionally strong as they are visually aesthetic.\n<h3>A Note About Reps</h3>\nLet me ask you a question. Do you think it’s possible do build iron pecs by doing endless repetitions of pushups? How about tree trunks for legs by doing bodyweight squats? While these exercises are awesome in their own right, they are simply insufficient and don't provide the needed resistance for you to grow the targeted muscles.\n\nThe same goes for your abs. I find it baffling that people to this day continue to do bodyweight sit-ups, thinking that it’s making their core stronger. While the high reps may be good for developing muscle endurance, it doesn’t create rock-hard strength that you can get from adding resistance.\n\nWith that in mind, here are a few good exercises for really hitting the abs.\n<h3>Decline Weighted Sit-Ups</h3>\nFor an increase in motion and resistance, perform sit-ups on a decline bench with a weight plate in both hands. The plate can be held close to your body or with your arms straight as the demonstrator is doing in the video. As you get stronger, increase resistance by using a heavier plate and/or raising the decline.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUvF2CiUyKg\n<h3>Sit-Ups (Muay Thai Style)</h3>\nYou don’t have to train in MMA or combat sports to do muay thai sit-ups. Perform sit-ups as you normally would but have a partner strike you in the abdomen with a striking pad. Alternatively, your partner can also lightly strike your abdomen with a karate chop using about 50% force.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSafFL2wRJM\n<h3>Rope Crunch Pulldowns</h3>\nKneel down in front of a cable pulldown machine, grab the rope, and pull down using your ab muscles. For maximum ab contraction, exhale as you’re pulling down. Watch the video below to see the way I like to perform them\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlxpafDemWI\n<h3>When to Do Your Ab Training</h3>\nIt’s up to you when you train the abs. If weight training, then I suggest you perform them as the last exercise after completing the more important compound movements. If you’re doing interval training, then ab exercises can be done in place of your rest.\n\nIf you have done HIIT cardio and feel you are up for it, then perform the exercises in place of the brief 20 second rest. Be forewarned, though, this isn’t for the faint of heart. It will push your muscles and conditioning to the absolute limit.\n<h3>Give Your Core the Workout of Its Life</h3>\nForget the sit-ups; add some serious resistance. If you’re not feeling the intense burn, then you’re not efficiently training your abs.\n\nRemember, a total body workout – along with cardio – is what builds muscle and strips away the fat that gets your midsection showing.\n\nCheck out my program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddesolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a> for more information about burning fat and building muscles.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2557\" src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/26150923/water-brandon.png\" alt=\"water-brandon\" width=\"698\" height=\"466\" /></p>\n\n<p>As a lot of you already know, I’m a huge proponent of working the abs even though ab exercises are not what get the muscles in your midsection to show.

It is so easy to get off track with your eating. When you’re busy with work and family commitments, it’s easy to opt for takeout or a bag of chips in that vending machine. This is why planning ahead is so crucial. Writing everything down on a meal plan template and having meals planned ahead for the entire week makes it so much easier to stay on path.\n<h3>Be Super Organized</h3>\nI’m all about pre-planning, and I plan all my meals for a full week in advance. Yes, I know it sounds like an overkill to plan what you’re going to have for lunch on Friday when it’s barely Monday. However, when you actually record on a scheduler what you intend on having, then you are less likely to deviate from it even when circumstances cause a disturbance to your routine.\n\nThat's the benefit of me writing your meal plan for you as well. Less pain means you'll do it longer.\n<h3>How to Plan</h3>\nWith apps for just about everything these days, you can simply download a scheduler app for your smartphone. This way, you have the schedule right in front of you wherever you’re at. If you’re more old-fashioned, you can record everything on a dry-erase board and place the board somewhere in your kitchen. This also provides quick reference when you prepare your meal the night before.\n\nNote: On the subject of preparing your meals the night before, that is something you are currently doing, right? If not, then I urge you to begin doing so. It only takes 10-20 minutes of your time each evening, and the payoff is huge.\n\nSimilarly, you can also record everything on a pocket organizer. Furthermore, meal plan templates can also be printed for free online. Here are a few good ones from <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/116038127868691153\">Pinterest</a>. Templates can also be created through Excel or by inserting a table chart on a Word document. It really doesn’t matter how you go about creating a template as long as you have one and adhere to it like glue.\n\nYou can watch this video on how to customize your own template.

It is so easy to get off track with your eating. When you’re busy with work and family commitments, it’s easy to opt for takeout or a bag of chips in that vending machine. This is why planning ahead is so crucial. Writing everything down on a meal plan template and having meals planned ahead for the entire week makes it so much easier to stay on path.  </p>\n\n<h3>Be Super Organized</h3>  \n\n<p>I’m all about pre-planning, and I plan all my meals for a full week in advance. Yes, I know it sounds like an overkill to plan what you’re going to have for lunch on Friday when it’s barely Monday. However, when you actually record on a scheduler what you intend on having, then you are less likely to deviate from it even when circumstances cause a disturbance to your routine.</p>\n\n<p>That's the benefit of me writing your meal plan for you as well. Less pain means you'll do it longer.  </p>\n\n<h3>How to Plan</h3>  \n\n<p>With apps for just about everything these days, you can simply download a scheduler app for your smartphone. This way, you have the schedule right in front of you wherever you’re at. If you’re more old-fashioned, you can record everything on a dry-erase board and place the board somewhere in your kitchen. This also provides quick reference when you prepare your meal the night before.</p>\n\n<p>Note: On the subject of preparing your meals the night before, that is something you are currently doing, right? If not, then I urge you to begin doing so. It only takes 10-20 minutes of your time each evening, and the payoff is huge.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, you can also record everything on a pocket organizer. Furthermore, meal plan templates can also be printed for free online. Here are a few good ones from <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/116038127868691153\">Pinterest</a>. Templates can also be created through Excel or by inserting a table chart on a Word document. It really doesn’t matter how you go about creating a template as long as you have one and adhere to it like glue.</p>\n\n<p>You can watch this video on how to customize your own template. It's a bit lengthy and a bit of a bore to watch, but it contains really helpful information.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwo-NjZz6sM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwo-NjZz6sM</a>  </p>\n\n<h3>A Final Word</h3>  \n\n<p>Even if you don’t like confining yourself to a set schedule, trust me when I say that being organized in this instance will keep you from straying.

Of course, nothing worth having in life comes easy. If you want a tight waistline, then you need cardio and a disciplined diet to burn more calories than what your body takes in. So many people stray during their fat loss journey, which is why they are doomed to fail. To stay on course, follow my meal plan for a flat belly.\n<h3>What It Means to Be a Disciplined Eater</h3>\nIn my experience, I notice that people tend to stray from their diet much more so than from their workouts. It’s a bit of an anomaly to me that people are willing to bust their ass in the gym but allow themselves so much wiggle room when it comes to their diet.\n\nIf you want the flat belly of a Victoria’s Secret or Calvin Klein model, then you need to follow a weekly meal plan and actually stick to it.\n\nIt all comes down to planning. With me, I always plan my meals the night before. This way, the meal can be consumed as is or be ready with a short heat up in the microwave. I always take about 15 minutes before going to bed to prepare my meals for tomorrow. I usually do this even when I don’t have to work or don't have any other major commitments the next day.\n<h3>Typical Meal for a Toned Belly</h3>\nIf you’re aiming for shredded abs, then you have to consume lesser calories on most days. Here is a sample of what a meal plan for a flat belly should look like:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"192\">7:00 am (breakfast)</td>\n<td width=\"192\">1 fruit, 1 cup skim milk<strong> </strong></td>\n<td width=\"192\">250 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"192\">9:30 am</td>\n<td width=\"192\">¼ cup nuts, 1-inch cube cheddar</td>\n<td width=\"192\">200 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"192\">12:30 pm (lunch)</td>\n<td width=\"192\">Tuna sandwich on flat bread w/ olive oil dressing, salad</td>\n<td width=\"192\">350 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"192\">3:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"192\">1 fruit</td>\n<td width=\"192\">100 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"192\">6:00 pm (dinner)</td>\n<td width=\"192\"> Lean steak, steamed vegetables</td>\n<td width=\"192\">200 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"192\">9:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"192\">1 cup skim milk</td>\n<td width=\"192\">100 calories</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nAs you may have noticed, the meal plan contains very little carbohydrates except for some fruit and a little bit of complex carbs for lunch. Keep carbs minimal, preferably 10%-25% of your total meal. There should also be zero refined carbs with the exception of fresh or frozen fruit. On your strength training days, however, you may consume refined carbs (e.g. white rice, white bread) immediately before or after your workout. Refrain from consuming carbs of any kind (including fruit) after your fourth meal.\n\nThough not mentioned in the chart, the meal plan should also consist of at least one gallon of water consumed with meals and in between. It is important that you stay hydrated while trying to lose fat. Being dehydrated by even just 1% lowers blood volume. This reduces the blood’s ability to deliver oxygen, which in turn slows your metabolism, and in turn, fat loss.\n<h3>Eat Your Way to a Flatter Belly</h3>\nIf you’re having trouble coming up with weekly meals or are unsure about the ratios, then please allow me to <a href=\"http://brolabsmealplan.com/\">customize a meal plan</a> on your behalf. With me personalizing your meals, I guarantee you will have the perfect dietary regimen conducive for maximum fat loss.\n\nYou need a specific meal plan for a flat belly because not all foods are created equal.

What diabetes doesn’t control, however, is your musculature. Even as a diabetic, it is still completely possible to develop six pack abs and gain muscle. A 1,200-calorie diabetic meal plan can be incorporated into a weekly eating schedule for long-term health and body development.\n<h3>What to Eat and not Eat</h3>\nBelieve it or not, a diabetic diet is not that different from the type of diet I follow and recommend to others. Basically, diabetics should consume healthy and natural foods high in protein and moderate in carbs and fats. Diabetics especially need to be careful when consuming carbs. It is essential that they stick to complex carbs, such as whole grains and wheats. They should try to avoid refined carbs as much as possible. Diabetic or not, though, refined carbs should be greatly limited anyways, so this isn’t a major restriction. Fruits, however, are acceptable as long as you keep track of the carb count.\n<h3>What’s the Ratio?</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/27223900/3535032264_973c9f5d1c_m-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/27223900/3535032264_973c9f5d1c_m-1.jpg\" alt=\"3535032264_973c9f5d1c_m (1)\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></a>This is something you will need to speak to your doctor with since no two diabetics respond to insulin the exact same way. It all comes down to your carb-to-insulin ratio. Generally, adults can safely consume up to 15 grams of carbs for every unit of fast-acting insulin taken. This doesn’t take into account, however, the amount of insulin produced naturally by the body, since even type II diabetics are still able to produce some insulin.\n\nYou can follow this <a href=\"http://www.bd.com/us/diabetes/page.aspx?cat=7001&amp;id=7303\">chart</a> that calculates the amount of carbs you can consume based on the number of shots taken per day.\n<h3>What About Cheat Days?</h3>\nYes, diabetics can still have cheat days, though they will need to be a little more mindful of what they eat. Contrary to popular belief, having diabetes doesn’t mean you can never enjoy an occasional treat.

What diabetes doesn’t control, however, is your musculature. Even as a diabetic, it is still completely possible to develop six pack abs and gain muscle. A 1,200-calorie diabetic meal plan can be incorporated into a weekly eating schedule for long-term health and body development.  </p>\n\n<h3>What to Eat and not Eat</h3>  \n\n<p>Believe it or not, a diabetic diet is not that different from the type of diet I follow and recommend to others. Basically, diabetics should consume healthy and natural foods high in protein and moderate in carbs and fats. Diabetics especially need to be careful when consuming carbs. It is essential that they stick to complex carbs, such as whole grains and wheats. They should try to avoid refined carbs as much as possible. Diabetic or not, though, refined carbs should be greatly limited anyways, so this isn’t a major restriction. Fruits, however, are acceptable as long as you keep track of the carb count.  </p>\n\n<h3>What’s the Ratio?</h3>  \n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/27223900/3535032264_973c9f5d1c_m-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/27223900/3535032264_973c9f5d1c_m-1.jpg\" alt=\"3535032264_973c9f5d1c_m (1)\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></a>This is something you will need to speak to your doctor with since no two diabetics respond to insulin the exact same way. It all comes down to your carb-to-insulin ratio. Generally, adults can safely consume up to 15 grams of carbs for every unit of fast-acting insulin taken. This doesn’t take into account, however, the amount of insulin produced naturally by the body, since even type II diabetics are still able to produce some insulin.</p>\n\n<p>You can follow this <a href=\"http://www.bd.com/us/diabetes/page.aspx?cat=7001&amp;id=7303\">chart</a> that calculates the amount of carbs you can consume based on the number of shots taken per day.  </p>\n\n<h3>What About Cheat Days?</h3>  \n\n<p>Yes, diabetics can still have cheat days, though they will need to be a little more mindful of what they eat. Contrary to popular belief, having diabetes doesn’t mean you can never enjoy an occasional treat. By all means, have a cookie or a serving of pie; just be sure the carb count stays within your limit.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/16195156/TEST-3.jpg\" alt=\"TEST 3\" /> <br />\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/16195156/11953095_1038662352824396_1955587238591426926_n.jpg\" alt=\"11953095_1038662352824396_1955587238591426926_n\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Here are two students of mine that are dedicated to eating the right way to get to the best versions of their selves.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Remember Supplements can help, but they are only meant to be a supplements.

Of course, it’s mostly men who fall into the latter category. Some guys are naturally skinny and want to put on muscle weight. These people are often termed “hardgainers” in the bodybuilding community. I was a hardgainer at one point, especially during my high school years. It took me many years to finally realize that to gain muscle, you need to follow a bodybuilding <a href=\"http://brolabsmealplan.com/\">meal plan</a> on top of your strength training routine.\n<h3>Eating for Lean Muscle Gains</h3>\nFor a bodybuilding physique, you have to eat like a bodybuilder. In addition to healthy eating, you also have to eat more than your body burns. This will ensure that you put on as much muscle as possible while preventing fat gain or keeping it to a minimum.</p><p>You’re going to have to get used to eating A LOT, especially on your training days.\n<h3>How Much You Need to Eat</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/31003644/8573622428_2557f251cb_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/31003644/8573622428_2557f251cb_n.jpg\" alt=\"8573622428_2557f251cb_n\" width=\"320\" height=\"298\" /></a>You need to go above the average daily recommended calorie allowance. If you’re just starting out, and you’re more concerned about muscle gain than fat loss, then I recommend starting at 20x your body weight in calories (For example if you weigh 170lbs you would consume 3400 calories per day. During a muscle building phase I suggest you limit – but not completely forgo – HIIT cardio training to three times per week. This prevents too much fat accumulation without compromising muscle gains.\n\nAt the end of every week, measure your body with a tape measure. I suggest measuring your chest, waist, biceps, thighs and calves. As long as you see gains, continue to consume the same amount of calories. If not, then increase the calories by 300-500 per day. If a 500-calorie increase is too much for you or you're gaining too much fat, then stick to 300.\n<h3>What to Eat</h3>\nYour body needs fuel in order to build muscle, and it needs an ample amount of protein, carbs, and fat. I don’t recommend low carbs if muscle building is your main goal since your muscles need it for energy. I would suggest a ratio of 50% protein, 25%-35% carbs, and 15%-25% fat.\n\nWhen it comes to food choice, avoid empty calories and junk food. Training hard in the gym is not a license to eat whatever you want. Foods need to be nutrient-dense without preservatives like trans-fatty acids or high fructose corn syrup.\n\nYou can watch the video below to check out some of my favorite bodybuilding foods that I recommend for optimum muscle gains.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/udYebKcyPK8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Sample Meal Plan</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">7:00 am breakfast/pre-workout</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 banana, 1 cup whole milk, 1 scoop whey protein, 1 bagel w/ peanut butter spread</td>\n<td width=\"213\">700 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">9:30 am post-workout</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1 banana, 1 cup whole milk, 1.5 scoop whey protein, ½ cup oatmeal, ¼ cup raisins</td>\n<td width=\"213\">700 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">12:00 pm lunch</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Chicken breast sandwich on wheat toasted bread, 1 cup steamed vegetables, 1 cup whole milk</td>\n<td width=\"213\">500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">3:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">½ cup peanuts, 1 cup whole milk, 1 fruit</td>\n<td width=\"213\">350 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">6:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Lean steak, mixed vegetables, ½ cup brown rice</td>\n<td width=\"213\">500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">9:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"213\">I cup whole milk, ¼ cup peanuts</td>\n<td width=\"213\">250 calories</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThis is a sample meal plan for a strength training day, which you should be performing 3-5 times a week. For non-training days, or days that you only do cardio, cut calories by 25%-30%.\n\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/10/31044745/11949543_1124191854275785_1878890828575182879_n1-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"11949543_1124191854275785_1878890828575182879_n\" />\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-34934\" src=\"http://brandoncarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2016-05-03-at-5.27.55-PM-250x245.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-05-03 at 5.27.55 PM\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-34935\" src=\"http://brandoncarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2016-05-03-at-5.31.16-PM-250x251.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-05-03 at 5.31.16 PM\" />\n\n<em style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Here are two pictures of students of mine that are focused on eating right and gaining lean muscle.</p><p>There is no such thing as someone that can’t gain muscle.

We eliminate the guesswork involved with building your own meals or trying to come up with a plan on your own.\n<h3>A Word on Supplements</h3>\nSupplements are useful in the sense that they’re convenient, but they’re not superior, or more beneficial, than food. If you choose to use supplements, then I suggest you stick to a good pre-workout like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a>. This helps you stay focused in the gym so you can use the food you eat to its highest potential.\n\nWhat about weight gain supplements? Personally, I don’t recommend them because most brands do not contain the right protein/carb/fat ratio. A lot of them also contain carbs in the form of sugar. If you choose to use a weight gainer, then limit the use to your post workout meals.\n<h3>A Useful Tip</h3>\nFor some people, consuming 3,000 calories and upward is too much for them to handle even when food intake is divided over six or seven meals.</p><p>If you’re having trouble adjusting, then add an extra meal in the middle of the night. It will be a small 200-300 calorie meal consisting of milk or a meal replacement shake. Set the drink next to your nightstand and set your alarm for the middle of the night. When it goes off, get up, consume the beverage, and go back to sleep. It only takes two minutes, and you get in a few extra hundred calories to fuel muscle growth.\n<h3>Eat, Exercise, Sleep, Rinse, and Repeat</h3>\nWhen you’re trying to build muscle, eating becomes an organized and timed process that you have to squeeze into your schedule no matter how inconvenient it becomes. Following a bodybuilding meal plan is a lifestyle that requires dedication and forgoing a few conveniences. Your efforts, though, will become apparent when you see a whole different person in the mirror.\n\nTo build lean muscle mass without gaining fat in the process, follow <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a> program. It will help you learn how to burn fat and build muscle with a quickness.\n\n[photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/85598619@N00/2651886872\">Lin Mei</a>, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/55839512@N08/8573622428\">Arya Zial</a>]","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Just as many people are self-conscious about being overweight, others are self-conscious about being too skinny.

Even if you have never taken creatine before, you have likely read some literature about it. While I believe people should naturally be skeptical when it comes to supplements, creatine is one product that I do recommend due to the more than handful of studies available.\n<h3>What Does Creatine Do?</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/29213256/2651274823_5f75803052_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/29213256/2651274823_5f75803052_n.jpg\" alt=\"2651274823_5f75803052_n\" width=\"213\" height=\"320\" /></a>For the gym rats out there, know that creatine does help build muscle. It does so by promoting cell volumization, which is accomplished by driving water into the muscle cells. In addition, creatine also enhances physical performance by aiding in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is a chemical produced naturally in the skeletal muscles and is instrumental for the body during anaerobic activity.\n\nThe anabolic effects of creatine have been well documented in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9390981\">study</a>. Furthermore, separate <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19741313\">studies</a> also show that creatine intake increases testosterone production.\n<h3>How to Take Creatine</h3>\nCreatine requires a loading phase for first-time users. The dosage is simple: take 5g four to five times for the first seven days. Afterwards, you can stick to a maintenance phase of 5g once a day. The loading phase should be repeated if you have been off creatine for four or more weeks.\n\nAlso keep in mind that you need to drink a lot of water for creatine to work. Remember, creatine promotes cell volumization by driving water into muscle cells. It can’t do that if there’s insufficient water in your body. I recommend drinking at least one gallon of water a day, which you should be doing anyways if you’re physically active.\n<h3>Why I Recommend It</h3>\nThe good thing about creatine is that it’s relatively inexpensive compared to other supplements. A bulk bottle costs a little over $20 and contains 1,000g. That’s 200 servings per bottle. That is a pretty good bargain for a valuable product proven to increase performance.\n<h3>A Note About Creatine Variations</h3>\nWhen shopping for creatine, stick with regular creatine monohydrate and resist the temptation to try out some of the more expensive variations. The supplement industry has released different versions often touted as creatine 2.0 or creatine on steroids. Cell-Tech by the popular supplement company Muscle-Tech is a prime example of a hyped up creatine that costs five times as much. How is Cell-Tech better? It contains dextrose (a fancy word for sugar), which supposedly increases absorption. A single serving of Cell-Tech with 10g of creatine contains – get this – a whopping 75g of sugar! Even if it does work better, all that sugar is just plain unhealthy and will also make you fat.\n\nCell-Tech isn’t the only culprit. There are other creatine supplements purporting to have superior transport systems. Some of these include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Micronized creatine</li>\n \t<li>Conjugated creatine</li>\n \t<li>Tri-creatine malate</li>\n \t<li>Creatine ethyl ester</li>\n</ul>\nIf you don’t mind experimenting and are willing to shell out the extra dollars, then by all means go for it. However, there are no independent studies I know of that verifies the efficiency of these creatine types.\n<h3>Make It a Part of Your Supplement Stack</h3>\nIf you take other supplements like whey protein, then I recommend adding creatine monohydrate. Even better, you can simply supplement with <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\">Rebellion</a>, which contains 3g of creatine monohydrate per serving along with a propriety blend of five other ingredients proven to increase energy and fire you up for your workout.\n\n[photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/85598619@N00/2651274823\">Lin Mei</a>\"></iframe>\n<a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\" target=\"_blank\">\nLearn More About Rebellion\n</a>\"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>If you dabbled with performance supplements, then you are likely no stranger to creatine monohydrate and its many incarnations.

This is beneficial because it keeps the workout duration short, which means I can quickly knock it out of the way and get on with my day. Of course, many people opt to train at moderate intensity for longer durations because it’s less challenging. If you want fast results, though, you’re going to have to train with some grit, and that entails pushing your body to the limit. There is no better way of getting that done than through Tabata HIIT cardio.\n<h3>What Is Tabata?</h3>\nTabata is a HIIT variation named after Japanese scientist Dr. Izumi Tabata. The workout was tested by Tabata and his team at Tokyo’s National Institute of Fitness and Sports.\n\nIn the study, subjects were divided into two groups; one group performed Tabata four days a week for six weeks; each training session lasted 4 minutes and 20 seconds. The second group also trained for six weeks but exercised five times a week at moderate intensity. At the conclusion of the study, the latter group improved their aerobic endurance but showed no increase in anaerobic strength. The Tabata group improved their aerobic conditioning as well but also saw anaerobic strength improve by 28%.\n\nYou can learn more about Dr. Tabata and his research <a href=\"http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/eng/html/research/areas/feat-researchers/interview/izumi_t.html/\">here</a>.\n<h3>The Training Regimen</h3>\nAs indicated in the study, Tabata sessions are short; only 4 minutes and 20 seconds. Make no mistake, though, during those 4 minutes plus, you are going to feel like you’re going to die. As such, it is not for the faint of heart and newbies.

This is beneficial because it keeps the workout duration short, which means I can quickly knock it out of the way and get on with my day. Of course, many people opt to train at moderate intensity for longer durations because it’s less challenging. If you want fast results, though, you’re going to have to train with some grit, and that entails pushing your body to the limit. There is no better way of getting that done than through Tabata HIIT cardio.  </p>\n\n<h3>What Is Tabata?</h3>  \n\n<p>Tabata is a HIIT variation named after Japanese scientist Dr. Izumi Tabata. The workout was tested by Tabata and his team at Tokyo’s National Institute of Fitness and Sports.</p>\n\n<p>In the study, subjects were divided into two groups; one group performed Tabata four days a week for six weeks; each training session lasted 4 minutes and 20 seconds. The second group also trained for six weeks but exercised five times a week at moderate intensity. At the conclusion of the study, the latter group improved their aerobic endurance but showed no increase in anaerobic strength. The Tabata group improved their aerobic conditioning as well but also saw anaerobic strength improve by 28%.</p>\n\n<p>You can learn more about Dr. Tabata and his research <a href=\"http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/eng/html/research/areas/feat-researchers/interview/izumi_t.html/\">here</a>.  </p>\n\n<h3>The Training Regimen</h3>  \n\n<p>As indicated in the study, Tabata sessions are short; only 4 minutes and 20 seconds. Make no mistake, though, during those 4 minutes plus, you are going to feel like you’re going to die. As such, it is not for the faint of heart and newbies.

I believe it’s a waste of time doing sit-ups for 1,000 reps when you can effectively strengthen your abs doing a more advanced exercise for about 10 reps or so. The good news is you don’t need expensive and bulky equipment to get a killer midsection training. All you need are some inexpensive ab workout equipment that you can find at your local sports and fitness store. Below is my list of recommended items for getting in an intense workout that will absolutely scorch your abs.\n<h3>Ab Wheel</h3>\nAn ab wheel only costs about $10 and allows you to get in a killer ab exercise without lying on your back. For more advanced folks, the basic repetition performed on your knees may be almost as easy as a sit-up. If so, then you can increase difficulty by executing the exercise from a standing position.\n\nNote: Most ab wheels actually come with two wheels placed side by side. Another way to increase difficulty is to remove one of the wheels. Using only one wheel slightly increases the difficulty as you have to use your ab muscles to keep the wheel from tipping over.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVYg6qAntf4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Power Wheel</h3>\nThis is similar to the ab wheel except the wheel is strapped to your feet. Essentially, you’ll be performing the exercise by rolling out with your legs as opposed to your hands. A rollout performed this way is a lot more challenging as it requires your stabilizer muscles to really tighten to maintain balance. The power wheel is a little more expensive, but it’s a great investment if you no longer feel challenged using a conventional ab wheel.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_EQo22Q3Dlk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Pushup Bars</h3>\nYes, pushup bars are for, well, pushups. However, there are other ways to make good use of these versatile handles. There are a few isometric exercises you can do that target the abs. One such exercise is the planche in the upright position. To execute the movement, sit on the floor with the bars at your side. Grip them and push your butt off the floor with your legs straight and parallel with the floor. Hold the position for as long as you can.\n\nIf you want to be a total badass, then practice the regular planche, which is done in the pushup position with the legs off the floor and in the air. Basically, your abs will be doing all the work to keep the legs airborne. This movement is a true feat of ab strength and usually takes several months of training in progressive stages.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uui2CV4XEic\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Resistance Bands</h3>\nResistance bands add difficulty to various body callisthenic exercises. They are great for targeting your obliques, the part of the abdominals that are almost always overlooked. While most ab exercises do recruit obliques as a secondary muscle, resistance bands allow you to perform the oblique twist exercise that targets the muscle directly. To do the exercise, secure the center of the band to a pole of doorknob. Holding the handles with your arms out, twist away from the center of the pole or door as if you were swinging a baseball bat. When you can whip out 10 reps with ease, transition to thicker bands or use more than one band.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5SNYAae5flM\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>That’s All You Need</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nMake sure to check out my program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a> for more information on burning fat and building muscles.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>As most of you already know, I am no fan of ab exercises performed at an extremely high rep range.

One way I do this is by coming up with new workout modalities. For my <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/videos/abs-workouts/\" target=\"_blank\">abs</a>, I like devising unconventional training regimens. One such routine is the 10 minute abs challenge.\n<h3>Try It</h3>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ci-T6l4AU7g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nWatch the video to see how the challenge works. It requires zero equipment and is broken into the following format:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Crunches</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Mountain climbers</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Leg lifts</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Mountain climbers</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Oblique twist</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Mountain climbers</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nNote that there is no rest in between exercises until you complete the entire cycle. I must forewarn you that this challenge is very intense. Try it once, and if it’s too much for you, then just shoot for two cycles or even just one.\n\nI like this challenge because it requires no equipment and minimal space. As you can see in the video, I’m practically doing the workout just outside a doorway.\n<h3>Create Your Own 10 Minute Abs Challenge</h3>\nYou can also create your own abs challenge using the same format but with different exercises. When it comes to a challenge like this, I don’t recommend using exercises that require weights. First of all, the challenge is already intense as it is with bodyweight exercises; it’s highly doubtful you’ll be able to complete the entire 10 minutes if you add weights for increased resistance. On the other hand, if you routinely perform the challenge and get pretty good at it, then by all means go for it.\n\nHere are a few other ab challenge samples for you to try out:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Sit-ups</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">plank</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">V-ups</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">plank</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Leg raises (on dip station)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">plank</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Crunches on medicine ball</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Flutter kicks</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Side bends w/ light dumbbells</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Flutter kicks</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Reverse crunch</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Flutter kicks</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Increase the Difficulty</h3>\nAs stated, you can increase the challenge by adding weights. Another way to increase the difficulty up a notch is to gradually increase the exercise duration while shortening the rest period. Try increasing each exercise to 35 seconds while decreasing rest time to 50 seconds. You can progress from there by increasing the exercise duration to 40 seconds each and shortening rest to 45 seconds. Of course, the exercise will slightly be longer than 10 minutes, but this will only improve your endurance.\n<h3>Always Challenge Yourself</h3>\nMy philosophy is that if you’re not pushing yourself, then you’re not progressing. This applies to every facet of life but especially to physical fitness. The 10 minute abs challenge is just one workout designed to push yourself to keep going even when your body is screaming for you to stop.\n\nCheck out my program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a> for more information.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>I don’t know about you, but I love physically challenging myself every now and then.

It requires zero equipment and is broken into the following format:  </p>\n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Crunches</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Mountain climbers</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Leg lifts</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Mountain climbers</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Oblique twist</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Mountain climbers</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<p>Note that there is no rest in between exercises until you complete the entire cycle. I must forewarn you that this challenge is very intense. Try it once, and if it’s too much for you, then just shoot for two cycles or even just one.</p>\n\n<p>I like this challenge because it requires no equipment and minimal space. As you can see in the video, I’m practically doing the workout just outside a doorway.  </p>\n\n<h3>Create Your Own 10 Minute Abs Challenge</h3>  \n\n<p>You can also create your own abs challenge using the same format but with different exercises. When it comes to a challenge like this, I don’t recommend using exercises that require weights. First of all, the challenge is already intense as it is with bodyweight exercises; it’s highly doubtful you’ll be able to complete the entire 10 minutes if you add weights for increased resistance. On the other hand, if you routinely perform the challenge and get pretty good at it, then by all means go for it.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few other ab challenge samples for you to try out:  </p>\n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Sit-ups</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">plank</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">V-ups</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">plank</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Leg raises (on dip station)</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">plank</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Crunches on medicine ball</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Flutter kicks</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Side bends w/ light dumbbells</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Flutter kicks</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Reverse crunch</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Flutter kicks</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Rest 1 minute</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<h3>Increase the Difficulty</h3>  \n\n<p>As stated, you can increase the challenge by adding weights. Another way to increase the difficulty up a notch is to gradually increase the exercise duration while shortening the rest period. Try increasing each exercise to 35 seconds while decreasing rest time to 50 seconds. You can progress from there by increasing the exercise duration to 40 seconds each and shortening rest to 45 seconds. Of course, the exercise will slightly be longer than 10 minutes, but this will only improve your endurance.  </p>\n\n<h3>Always Challenge Yourself</h3>  \n\n<p>My philosophy is that if you’re not pushing yourself, then you’re not progressing. This applies to every facet of life but especially to physical fitness. The 10 minute abs challenge is just one workout designed to push yourself to keep going even when your body is screaming for you to stop.</p>\n\n<p>Check out my program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a> for more information.</p>","amp":null,"image":"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/12/IMG_4155.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-11-24 11:00:14","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-11-24 11:00:14","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-11-24 11:00:14","published_by":1},{"id":2232,"uuid":"8d9b3a50-8c0d-4133-bcf3-8c22459ba0e8","title":"How Long Should You Rest Between Sets?","slug":"how-long-should-you-rest-between-sets","markdown":"One of the questions I get a lot is how long I rest between sets? I don’t really believe there is an optimum rest time; it’s about training to ABSOLUTE failure. As long you do that each and every set, then the rest period is more a secondary factor. Personally, I like to keep my rests short, usually no more than one minute and even as short as 10 seconds in some instances.\n<h3>Keep It Brief</h3>\nIn the past, I have rested as long as three minutes. I’ve heard of others who would rest as long as five minutes. To me, that is way too long and unnecessarily extends the time in the gym. I also know of people who don’t time their rest at all and would lose track of time between sets in order to socialize.\n\nI firmly believe you should time your sets and keep the resting period brief. Recently, my rests have been 60 seconds; this allows me just enough time to load or unload plates if using free weights.\n\nKeep in mind that resting time may also vary depending on the type of exercise. When it comes to ab exercises, for example, I like to keep it as short as possible, usually 10 to 30 seconds. If I’m doing decline sit-ups with a plate in hand, then I can easily swap out plates with a lighter one on the side without even getting off the bench, and it only takes about five seconds or so.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to bench presses or squats on a squat rack, then I might allow a longer rest period of 90 seconds or even two minutes. Changing out the plates on both ends of the barbell, after all, does take a little more time.\n\nYou can read this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19691365\">report</a> on the scientifically verified benefits of short rest intervals.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m5rXL2-n0K0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nWorkouts should also be no more than an hour at the most, and preferably under 45 minutes. Studies show that testosterone levels decline after the one hour mark during intense physical activity. If your workout includes multiple exercises, each with multiple sets, then prolonged resting periods may cause the workout to go over that mark.\n<h3>Use Your Resting Time to Improve Performance</h3>\nIf you perform any type of strength training, then you know you have to make improvements in the strength and endurance department in order to see gains. Most of the time, this is achieved either through increasing the weight or increasing the reps. Another way, though, is to shorten the rest period. In other words, if you normally rest one minutes between sets, then shorten it to 50 seconds and go from there. If you’re able to perform the same repetitions using the same amount of weight under a shorter resting period, then that is as much of a strength increase as being able to use more weights or whipping out an extra rep or two.\n<h3>Time Your Rest</h3>\nShort resting periods between sets give you less time to catch your breath or for your muscles to recover from the lactic buildup. It also means having to use lighter weights for subsequent sets. However, as long you train to failure every time, then you will continue to see muscle gains and fat loss. Plus, it will also keep training sessions well below the one hour mark.\n\nCheck out my program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>One of the questions I get a lot is how long I rest between sets?

There are no shortcuts; you have to go through the weekly regimen of dieting, cardio, and strength training. Nevertheless, there are ways of speeding up the process. Before I go into further detail, it helps to understand the scientific side of how weight loss works. Basically, your body burns calories via process known as thermogenesis.\n<h3>Thermo-What?</h3>\nSimply put, thermogenesis is the body’s ability to produce heat. Here’s the lo-down: the more heat your body produces, the more calories it burns. That means more fat loss and a fast track to a six-pack.\n\nThere are several ways to increase thermogenesis. The most common is through exercise, or any physical movement for that matter. If you’re walking, you create a greater state of thermogenesis than if you were sitting. If you jog, you increase heat production even further. If you sprint, perform HIIT cardio, or do some heavy compound exercise, then you really ramp up thermogenesis to its max. This is partly why I’m a huge advocate of keeping sessions brief but intense. When you’re exerting at your maximum capacity to the point where you feel like you’re going to die, you can bet that your body is in thermogenic overdrive.\n\nHere’s some good news to digest: there are other ways to induce thermogenesis besides exercise.\n<h3>Other Ways to Raise Thermal Body Temperature</h3>\nHow you eat also impacts the rate of thermogenesis. Yes, you have to consume less than your body burns, but the food choices are just as relevant. For one, you should consume a higher ratio of protein. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15466943\">Studies</a> have actually confirmed that a high protein intake actually induces thermogenesis, especially if protein is consumed in place of simple and refined carbs. Carbs also somewhat raise thermogenesis, while fats contribute the least.\n\nThis is why I’m a proponent of a high protein diet especially if fat loss is your primary goal. I recommend a ratio of 50% protein at the very least, though a ratio of 60% or 65% is even better, while carbs and fat can be equally divided among the remaining 35% to 40%.\n<h3>Expose Yourself to Extreme Cold</h3>\nWhen you’re exposed to cold temperatures, your body burns excess calories to produce heat. For maximum effect, it’s not enough to just step outside on a chilly day in T-shirt and shorts. You have to expose yourself to the point where you’re shivering. Taking a cold shower is not a bad idea, but for maximum thermogenesis, treat your body to an ice bath. Dunking your body in ice water is extremely intense and can send your body into shock. It can also cause 1<sup>st</sup> degree ice burns. This is something that will need to be eased into.\n\nOf course, ice baths require tons of ice; this makes it expensive not to mention time consuming to prepare. Watch this video below for an equally effective yet much more practical method.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/79Ev4IcXmxA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nThe method described above is known as shivering thermogenesis. There is also a second – and much less intense – method known as non-shivering thermogenesis. This is simply achieved by ingesting an ice cold beverage, which causes your body to raise its internal temperature as a counterbalance. Make it a habit to drink at least one gallon of refrigerated or ice water a day. This is the amount of water you should be drinking daily anyways if you are physically active, so making the transition to cold water isn’t much of a modification.\n<h3>Supplement with Natural Herbs</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/19150531/tearexx-how-ripped-do-you-want-to-be.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/19150531/tearexx-how-ripped-do-you-want-to-be-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"tearexx-how ripped do you want to be\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>Some herbs are also known to increase thermogenesis.

Yes, this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8184963\">study</a> confirms that alcohol indeed induces thermogenesis.\n\nSome of you may be tempted, then, to use that as an excuse for binging on beer and hoarding kegs in your garage.

It’s also about staying healthy physically, mentally, and emotionally. This is why a diet should contain rich concentrations of whole fruits and vegetables, which contain loads of antioxidants. Quercetin is one such antioxidant, and science has shown that this is a flavonoid you want more of in your body.\n<h3>Quercetin Explained</h3>\nQuercetin is found in the pigments of most fruits and veggies, including apples, oranges, grapes, dark berries, plums, onions, and even green tea. This antioxidant is a free radical fighter that protects your body from DNA and cell membrane damage.\n<h3>Why You Should Supplement With Quercetin</h3>\nStudies have confirmed a plethora of benefits associated with this common but little known flavonoid. Here are a few ways quercetin boosts your health and general well-being.\n\n<strong>It’s Good for the Heart</strong> – Quercetin helps stimulate blood flow, thus help maintaining pulmonary function and lowering oxidation. The last point is an important one because high blood oxidation is what causes bad cholesterol to cling to the artery walls. The heart-healthy benefit of quercetin has been confirmed in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17015250\">study</a>.\n\n<strong>It Lowers Blood Pressure</strong> – This <a href=\"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/137/11/2405.full\">research</a> confirms the hypertension-lowering effects of quercetin. This is especially the case among patients with pre-existing high blood pressure.\n\n<strong>Protects Against Stress</strong> – We all get stressed out from time to time. While stress is a part of life, too much of it also has physiological ramifications on your body. Stress causes the release of cortisol, which – as I have explained many times before in my previous posts – is a testosterone killer. This makes the hormone your worst nightmare if you’re a guy and trying to put on muscle mass.

It’s also about staying healthy physically, mentally, and emotionally. This is why a diet should contain rich concentrations of whole fruits and vegetables, which contain loads of antioxidants. Quercetin is one such antioxidant, and science has shown that this is a flavonoid you want more of in your body.  </p>\n\n<h3>Quercetin Explained</h3>  \n\n<p>Quercetin is found in the pigments of most fruits and veggies, including apples, oranges, grapes, dark berries, plums, onions, and even green tea. This antioxidant is a free radical fighter that protects your body from DNA and cell membrane damage.  </p>\n\n<h3>Why You Should Supplement With Quercetin</h3>  \n\n<p>Studies have confirmed a plethora of benefits associated with this common but little known flavonoid. Here are a few ways quercetin boosts your health and general well-being.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It’s Good for the Heart</strong> – Quercetin helps stimulate blood flow, thus help maintaining pulmonary function and lowering oxidation. The last point is an important one because high blood oxidation is what causes bad cholesterol to cling to the artery walls. The heart-healthy benefit of quercetin has been confirmed in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17015250\">study</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It Lowers Blood Pressure</strong> – This <a href=\"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/137/11/2405.full\">research</a> confirms the hypertension-lowering effects of quercetin. This is especially the case among patients with pre-existing high blood pressure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Protects Against Stress</strong> – We all get stressed out from time to time. While stress is a part of life, too much of it also has physiological ramifications on your body. Stress causes the release of cortisol, which – as I have explained many times before in my previous posts – is a testosterone killer. This makes the hormone your worst nightmare if you’re a guy and trying to put on muscle mass. This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19423323\">study</a> right here says it all about quercetin’s role in keeping cortisol levels in check.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Promotes Respiratory Health</strong> – Quercetin is also a known histamine inhibitor. Histamine is a compound naturally produced in the body and is also present in many foods. While the compound in small amounts is beneficial, too much of it is known to cause inflammation and common respiratory problems, such as coughing, headaches, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion.  </p>\n\n<h3>How to Get Your Daily Dose of Quercetin</h3>  \n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15161933/419758926_ed7f11223c_b-2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15161933/419758926_ed7f11223c_b-2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"419758926_ed7f11223c_b (2)\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>As mentioned, most fruits, especially, the citrus variety, contain high concentrations of quercetin.

It is rich in a substance called chlorogenic acid, which holds numerous benefits. The most notable – and the one that’s probably bound to get you most excited – is the antioxidant’s role in fat loss, which it accomplishes by boosting the metabolic output in your liver. This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20064576\">study</a> right here confirms the use of chlorogenic acid-rich coffee as a valid fat loss aid.\n\nIt is for this very reason, and among others, that green coffee bean extract is a chief ingredient in <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme\" target=\"_blank\">TeaRexx</a>.\n<h3>Green Coffee Bean Extract Slows the Aging Process</h3>\nFurthermore, green coffee bean extract also contains ferulic acid and Polyphenol.

In addition, it also promotes the production of collagen, which helps retain dermal elasticity and supple skin.\n\nPolyphenols are also known to fight harmful free radicals.

Achieving an awesome pump does indeed make you feel like you accomplished a kickass workout. However, there is so much more to vasodilation than just getting a pump.\n<h3>Vasodilation Explained</h3>\nVasodilation is basically the dilation (widening) of the blood vessels. This allows for greater blood flow, and more blood flow means more oxygen and nutrient delivery. Vessel dilation is usually achieved through increased concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) in the body, hence the popularity of NO supplements.\n<h3>Benefits of Vasodilation from a Fat Loss and Muscle Building Perspective</h3>\nPeople ranging from the average gym goer, to world class athletes, have used vasodilation supplements for their many documented benefits.\n\nThough often touted for its muscle building benefits, what’s lesser known is the effects of vasodilation on fat loss. Nitric oxide actually encourages the body to burn fat for fuel. One study showed that subjects who supplemented with L-arginine, (a known NO stimulator) showed increased levels of nonesterified fatty acids, a substance essential for lipid metabolism.\n\nIn this <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2805130/Exposure-UV-rays-releases-protein-helps-metabolism.html\">study</a>, it was proven that increased nitric oxide slows the rate of obesity as well as fight against the onset of type 2 diabetes.\n\nTea Rexx contains green tea, an ingredient proven in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19101751\">clinical research</a> to induce increased NO levels in the bloodstream.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17205621/16122086763_82b6fe905d_b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17205621/16122086763_82b6fe905d_b-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"Vasodilation\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a>Of course, NO supplements are more commonly taken for its muscle building benefits. More muscle, as you should know, also helps the body burn more calories. As mentioned earlier, NO really amplifies muscle pump during and after a workout. While the pump feels nice, it is not believed to play a role in muscle growth. Vasodilation, however, does aid muscle development in other ways.\n\nFor one, vasodilation increases oxygen levels, which in turn increases energy production during aerobic activity. That means it could help you get through those grueling <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/html5-blank/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">HIIT cardio sessions</a>. It also reduces lactic acid buildup. Lactic acid creates that burning sensation that you feel in your muscles especially during those last few reps. Reduced lactic acid means being able to get in that extra rep or two, thus helping you achieve ABSOLUTE failure that I always stress about.\n\nIn addition, taking a NO supplement in between workouts also speeds up recovery. The dilation of the vessels means more nutrients are delivered to hungry muscles. Expedient recovery is essential especially if you are performing both strength training and HIIT cardio to increase muscle mass while losing fat. This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC14889/\">study</a> verifies the benefits of NO for aiding in muscle recovery and repair.\n<h3>Vasodilation Takes Your Workout to the Next Level</h3>\nI’m a big proponent of training to the point where you absolutely can’t perform another rep or go for another second. This takes a lot of mental fortitude, and sometimes it helps to take a supplement that gives you that extra push.\n\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/20125349/scena_3bottles-300x188.jpg\" alt=\"TeaRexx\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" />This is what <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme\">Tea Rexx</a> is designed to do; the vasodilation effect gives you that extra pep so you achieve total muscle or cardio failure. Of course, you’ll still have to dig deep each training session, but you’ll have just enough in you to go just one step further.\n\n[photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/113047835@N04/16122086763\">Anton Petukhov</a>]","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>If you’ve ever picked up a bodybuilding magazine or supplement catalog, then I’m sure you’ve seen a few vasodilation supplements promoting insane muscle pumps during exercise.

In fact, more often than I would like to admit, I often feel fatigued before beginning a weight lifting session. This is typically the case on days where I do both <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/html5-blank/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">HIIT</a> and <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/html5-blank/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">strength</a> training. I normally do the former first thing in the morning and begin the latter first thing after work. I’m often pooped by the time I hit the weight room. It’s in scenarios like this that I rely on the benefits of a pre-workout formula like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\">Rebellion</a>.\n<h3>Why a Pre-Workout Formula? (and Why Rebellion?)</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/19185042/5713084285_6ebcc3d743_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/19185042/5713084285_6ebcc3d743_m.jpg\" alt=\"preworkout\" width=\"160\" height=\"240\" /></a>From my own experience, having a little “buzz” gives you a little more “spring” to your workout. Of course, cardio and strength training are 90% mental; nevertheless, it helps to have some extra energy reserve in your tank come gym time.\n\nWhen it comes to pre-workout drinks, there are boatloads of them on the market, so how do you know which ones work and which ones are loaded with crappy and unnatural ingredients? It all goes back to the ingredients. Stick to the ones that have long been proven to work. Be naturally suspicious when it comes to “breakthrough” ingredients cultivated from some ultra-rare, exotic plant in the Amazon. If you read bodybuilding magazines, then you know supplement companies are notorious for introducing new ingredients that are marketed as being so potent that it makes all others obsolete. Often, these so-called ingredients have nonexistent or very sketchy scientific studies behind them.\n\nThis is why I recommend Rebellion; it doesn’t rely on such hype and uses tried-and-true ingredients that have solid scientific backing. Some of the ingredients included are basics like <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a>, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">creatine</a>, and <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supercharge-your-workouts-with-beta-alanine/\" target=\"_blank\">beta alanine</a> just to list a few.\n\nCaffeine is obviously a stimulant that gives you an immediate energy boost. Don’t believe it works? 54% of Americans consume some sort of caffeinated beverage on a daily basis; I’m sure they would beg to differ, or else they wouldn’t be consumers.\n\nAs long as you stay within the recommended daily dosage (no more than 400mg), caffeine is absolutely safe and also contains a bevy of health benefits besides keeping you alert.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18135652/img_20150817_062845_1024.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18135652/img_20150817_062845_1024-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"img_20150817_062845_1024\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\nThe other Rebellion ingredient is creatine, which needs no introduction if you have ever dabbled in bodybuilding. Not only does creatine promote muscle cell volumization, but it also increases muscular output during intense anaerobic activity.\n\nThere are a few other proven ingredients, all of which I have gone into detail about in my previous posts. All you need to know is that taking Rebellion 30 minutes before workout amps you up and puts you “in the zone.”\n\n<strong>Below is a student of mine who gained an edge by taking <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>.</strong>\n\n<em>It doesn’t mean you have to take supplements to get these results, but you can see the difference one month can make; it can help speed things up in a healthy way.</em>\n\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/24163423/10377253_513439708812875_5815346300061137799_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<h3>A Final Word</h3>\nIn a perfect world, the human body would be absolutely upbeat and pumped from the moment we get out of bed until it’s time to hit the sack. Of course, our body tends to betray us by often feeling lethargic when it’s time for a workout. This requires us to use our mind and willpower to force our body to drag its ass in the gym when we are so not up for it. This is why a beneficial pre-workout formula like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> is needed at times to keep the physical body feeling vibrant and alive.\n\n[photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/48399297@N04/5713084285\">Defence Images</a>]","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Let me ask you a question: are you fully alert and motivated before EVERY strength training and HIIT cardio session?

Don’t believe it works? 54% of Americans consume some sort of caffeinated beverage on a daily basis; I’m sure they would beg to differ, or else they wouldn’t be consumers.</p>\n\n<p>As long as you stay within the recommended daily dosage (no more than 400mg), caffeine is absolutely safe and also contains a bevy of health benefits besides keeping you alert.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18135652/img_20150817_062845_1024.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18135652/img_20150817_062845_1024-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"img_20150817_062845_1024\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The other Rebellion ingredient is creatine, which needs no introduction if you have ever dabbled in bodybuilding. Not only does creatine promote muscle cell volumization, but it also increases muscular output during intense anaerobic activity.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few other proven ingredients, all of which I have gone into detail about in my previous posts. All you need to know is that taking Rebellion 30 minutes before workout amps you up and puts you “in the zone.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Below is a student of mine who gained an edge by taking <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>It doesn’t mean you have to take supplements to get these results, but you can see the difference one month can make; it can help speed things up in a healthy way.</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/24163423/10377253_513439708812875_5815346300061137799_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </p>\n\n<h3>A Final Word</h3>  \n\n<p>In a perfect world, the human body would be absolutely upbeat and pumped from the moment we get out of bed until it’s time to hit the sack.

While it’s true that you should eat every two to three hours for maximum muscle gain and fat loss, it also helps to go on an intermittent fasting every now and then.\n<h3>Why Go for a Period Without Eating?</h3>\nFasting is actually an age old practice that’s been around for ages. It has been used by Indian yogis and even ancient Greek philosophers like Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle. The practice is also a part of various religious and cultural rituals.\n\nFasting is used as a natural remedy for helping the body rid itself of toxins and restoring its natural balance.\n\nAside from making you healthier, it just might also help you lose that excess flab around your waist. Don’t worry; you don’t need to go for a full 24 hours without food, though you may if you wish.\n\nPeople actually fast every day; when you get out of bed each morning, you just went for eight hours without food. If you stopped eating about two hours before bed, and skip breakfast the next morning, that’s about 16 hours of fasting. This is actually how I do it and recommend to my clients.\n<h3>Fasting Routine</h3>\nI typically fast once a week, though I may recommend twice weekly for clients trying to safely lose maximum fat in the shortest time possible. When I fast, I’ll usually skip the last meal from the night before. The next morning, I’ll skip breakfast and the meal between breakfast and lunch. I’ll resume my regular meal schedule come lunch time.\n\nI recommend drinking plenty of water as this will help keep some of the hunger pangs at bay and keep you hydrated. If your stomach is really growling, you may munch on some sliced vegetables. Sometimes, just the act of chewing is enough to relieve hunger.\n\nIt’s also important to point out that when you begin resuming your meals, you need to consume the same number of calories each meal as you normally would. Some people who begin lunch after their fasting session tend to consume more calories to quell the hunger or compensate for the skipped meals. This is a mistake and defeats the purpose of fasting for fat loss in the first place. Overall, you should consume around 25% less calories than you normally would.\n\nOn a final note, I do not recommend fasting on strength training days. Doing cardio is fine, but you shouldn’t be doing any strenuous lifting on an empty stomach. Anaerobic activity without food for fuel may lead to premature fatigue and diminished performance. If you insist on strength training during fasting, then take a branch chain amino acid (BCAA) supplement prior to beginning exercise.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pj_Y1WKT4cU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Does It Work?</h3>\nScience has verified the benefits of short-term fasting.

Not surprisingly, these are also the same people that look the same day in and out. They don’t look an ounce more muscular or slimmer. These people either don’t understand the science behind muscle growth or they’re afraid of the punishing pain of compound lifts. I don’t blame the people who fall into the latter, but if they continue to stay in their “safe zone” of pink dumbbell curls, they have a fat chance of trimming down much less gaining lean muscle.\n<h3>Why Compound Lifts Are Necessary</h3>\nCompound exercises, as you should know, consist of exercises that work more than one muscle. Examples include squats, bench presses, and deadlifts. These exercises also enable you to use more weight due to the multiple muscle recruitment. Compound movements are also far more strenuous; if you done heavy barbell squats on a squat rack, then you know the pain factor is quadruple times more intense than the discomfort you may feel from a set of curls or arm extensions.\n\nWhen it especially comes to heavy squats, I get anxious before beginning a set because I know I’m going to be in a world of physical hurt for the next minute or two. Yet, such exercises are what send the signal to your muscle fibers that it must either adapt and grow or die. It puts the body in the state of stress where it releases maximum testosterone. With that in mind, I think it goes without saying that squats or bench presses will give you a far bigger testosterone rush than curls and the like. The intense strain also means more calories burned, thus more fat loss.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LDPW7c22Qik\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Don’t Make the Mistake I Did</h3>\nPerhaps you’re a “one muscle” type of person, meaning you only care about seeing gains in one muscle. When I started lifting during my teenage years, I was a one muscle guy; I wanted big beefy biceps, so I can wear sleeveless shirts and woo the girls while making the guys jealous.\n\nSince I wanted pythons for arms, all I did was isolation exercises: bicep curls, preacher curls, and tricep extensions. I would work the chest once in a while, though I did absolutely no leg or back work. I also worked my arms almost every day and was convinced that they would somehow get bigger if I kept up at it. Well, as I’m sure you can guess, my arms didn’t grow an ounce.\n\nIt wasn’t until many years later that I finally began studying bodybuilding literature and learned about the importance of compound lifts. Once I made the shift and some dieting modifications, that’s when I began putting on the muscle weight, both on my arms and elsewhere.\n\nThis is why I love flexing my guns at the beginning of some of my videos. My arms, along with my abs, are the muscle groups I love showing off the most.\n<h3>Should I Give Up Isolation Exercises Altogether?</h3>\nIf you’ve seen some of my videos or read some of my previous posts, I regularly tout the benefits of isolation exercises. They definitely have their place; it’s just that compound exercises are more important by several notches. As such, compound lifts should make up the bulk of your strength training, while isolation movements can be performed to end your workout.\n\nHere is a sample workout with a heavy emphasis on compound lifts:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Barbell squats</td>\n<td width=\"319\">3-4 sets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">deadlifts</td>\n<td width=\"319\">3-4 sets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Bench presses</td>\n<td width=\"319\">3-4 sets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Bicep curl</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2-3 sets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Lateral raises</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2-3 sets</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nIn this sample, the exercises would be performed in that order. The first three consist of compound movements while the last two are isolation exercises you may do in the end if you choose to. 90% of the focus and energy, though, should be given to the first three.\n\nOn a final note, I also recommend that all compound exercises (or even isolation ones for that matter) be done using free weights rather than on a machine. The few people I see in the gym that actually do perform compound exercises often do lifts like squats or bench presses on a smith machine as opposed to using an actual squat or bench rack with a free weight. Smith and cable machines “lock” your muscles in place and prevent your stabilizer muscles from getting in some of the work. Weak stabilizers leave you prone to injury.\n<h3>No Pain, No Gain</h3>\nBelieve me, I’m absolutely hating life when I’m in the middle of performing heavy squats or deadlifts. I recognize, however, that they’re necessary for putting my body in an anabolic state that just isn’t possible with isolation exercises alone. Make no mistake about it, compound lifts will make you dig deep, but you got to be willing to push forward in spite of the pain to get in that final rep. This will send a message to your muscles that you aren’t dicking around and that it better grow, or else.\n\nMake sure to check out my program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>I can’t tell you how many times I have seen people in the gym spend their entire session doing exercises like bicep curls or tricep pulldowns. Not surprisingly, these are also the same people that look the same day in and out. They don’t look an ounce more muscular or slimmer. These people either don’t understand the science behind muscle growth or they’re afraid of the punishing pain of compound lifts. I don’t blame the people who fall into the latter, but if they continue to stay in their “safe zone” of pink dumbbell curls, they have a fat chance of trimming down much less gaining lean muscle.  </p>\n\n<h3>Why Compound Lifts Are Necessary</h3>  \n\n<p>Compound exercises, as you should know, consist of exercises that work more than one muscle. Examples include squats, bench presses, and deadlifts. These exercises also enable you to use more weight due to the multiple muscle recruitment. Compound movements are also far more strenuous; if you done heavy barbell squats on a squat rack, then you know the pain factor is quadruple times more intense than the discomfort you may feel from a set of curls or arm extensions.</p>\n\n<p>When it especially comes to heavy squats, I get anxious before beginning a set because I know I’m going to be in a world of physical hurt for the next minute or two. Yet, such exercises are what send the signal to your muscle fibers that it must either adapt and grow or die. It puts the body in the state of stress where it releases maximum testosterone. With that in mind, I think it goes without saying that squats or bench presses will give you a far bigger testosterone rush than curls and the like. The intense strain also means more calories burned, thus more fat loss.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LDPW7c22Qik\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>  \n\n<h3>Don’t Make the Mistake I Did</h3>  \n\n<p>Perhaps you’re a “one muscle” type of person, meaning you only care about seeing gains in one muscle. When I started lifting during my teenage years, I was a one muscle guy; I wanted big beefy biceps, so I can wear sleeveless shirts and woo the girls while making the guys jealous.</p>\n\n<p>Since I wanted pythons for arms, all I did was isolation exercises: bicep curls, preacher curls, and tricep extensions. I would work the chest once in a while, though I did absolutely no leg or back work. I also worked my arms almost every day and was convinced that they would somehow get bigger if I kept up at it. Well, as I’m sure you can guess, my arms didn’t grow an ounce.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t until many years later that I finally began studying bodybuilding literature and learned about the importance of compound lifts. Once I made the shift and some dieting modifications, that’s when I began putting on the muscle weight, both on my arms and elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I love flexing my guns at the beginning of some of my videos. My arms, along with my abs, are the muscle groups I love showing off the most.  </p>\n\n<h3>Should I Give Up Isolation Exercises Altogether?</h3>  \n\n<p>If you’ve seen some of my videos or read some of my previous posts, I regularly tout the benefits of isolation exercises. They definitely have their place; it’s just that compound exercises are more important by several notches. As such, compound lifts should make up the bulk of your strength training, while isolation movements can be performed to end your workout.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a sample workout with a heavy emphasis on compound lifts:  </p>\n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Barbell squats</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">3-4 sets</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">deadlifts</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">3-4 sets</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Bench presses</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">3-4 sets</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Bicep curl</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">2-3 sets</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Lateral raises</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">2-3 sets</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<p>In this sample, the exercises would be performed in that order. The first three consist of compound movements while the last two are isolation exercises you may do in the end if you choose to. 90% of the focus and energy, though, should be given to the first three.</p>\n\n<p>On a final note, I also recommend that all compound exercises (or even isolation ones for that matter) be done using free weights rather than on a machine. The few people I see in the gym that actually do perform compound exercises often do lifts like squats or bench presses on a smith machine as opposed to using an actual squat or bench rack with a free weight. Smith and cable machines “lock” your muscles in place and prevent your stabilizer muscles from getting in some of the work. Weak stabilizers leave you prone to injury.  </p>\n\n<h3>No Pain, No Gain</h3>  \n\n<p>Believe me, I’m absolutely hating life when I’m in the middle of performing heavy squats or deadlifts. I recognize, however, that they’re necessary for putting my body in an anabolic state that just isn’t possible with isolation exercises alone. Make no mistake about it, compound lifts will make you dig deep, but you got to be willing to push forward in spite of the pain to get in that final rep. This will send a message to your muscles that you aren’t dicking around and that it better grow, or else.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure to check out my program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>.</p>","amp":null,"image":"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/12/DSC07374.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-12-01 11:00:41","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-12-01 11:00:41","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-12-01 11:00:41","published_by":1},{"id":2243,"uuid":"6f4de85f-88c0-47f0-8fe8-98f7a0a41036","title":"How to Lose Fat Cells to Achieve a Rock Hard Body","slug":"how-to-lose-fat-cells-to-achieve-a-rock-hard-body","markdown":"Why does the human anatomy carry body fat in the first place? The answer is simple: body fat is necessary for maintaining bodily functions. Due to a western diet and lifestyle, however, people tend to have more fat than they would like. So many people talk about losing fat; some go a little further and dig into the scientific aspect of it. It’s then that they ask questions regarding fat cells. How do you lose fat cells? Is that even possible?\n<h3>Fat Cells at a Glance</h3>\nEveryone has a certain number of fat cells; that’s true whether you’re obese or have body fat levels in the single digit range. Fat cells typically grow in number during childhood and remain constant once you reach adulthood. Like other cells, fat cells die and reproduce. Your genes basically determine the amount of fat cells you have in your body. The more you have the easier it is for you to get fat. That’s a part of your genetics that you have no control over.   <a href=\"/2015/11/27141333/IMG_1639-e1448651633163.jpg\"><img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/27141333/IMG_1639-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n\nWith that in mind, it’s possible to have a six pack and have more fat cells than someone that’s obese. As far as knowing how to lose fat cells and reducing their overall number, well, that’s not going to happen. While exercise and dieting do induce death of fat cells (a process called apoptosis), your body will signal for the creation of more to replace the ones that were lost.\n\nRemember, your body’s internal mechanism cares about survival, not how visible your abs are. Often times, it will also work against your quest for six pack abs. When you cut calories, for instance, the cells will release hormones like estrogen and leptin, which sends hunger signals to the brain.\n\nUltimately, you can’t really manipulate the number of fat cells, but you can keep them from swelling and ballooning up to multiple times their original size. Over consumption of calories and poor food choices are what cause these cells to be filled with fat.\n<h3>How to Shrink Fat Cells</h3>\nYour goal is to shrink or “deflate” fat cells, and the way to do that is through dieting and exercising the way I outline them in<a href=\"http://Thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\"> The Simple Shredded Solution</a>. Basically, you just follow the conventional wisdom associated with a fat loss diet, including consuming overall fewer calories, avoiding refined carbs, and limiting empty calories.\n\nYou should be eating more protein also. Compared to carbs and fat, protein is harder to digest, which forces your body to use more energy (calories) to break down the macronutrient. Most of my diet programs include a ratio breakdown of no less than 50% of your total calories coming from protein. In most cases, it’s closer to the 60% and 65% mark if fat loss is your primary quest.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lo1_n_EFgCY\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Don’t Get too Caught Up in the Science</h3>\nDon’t fret too much over your genetics and how many fat cells you suspect you may have.

However, high repetitions has its place as well. The benefits of muscular endurance is actually pivotal for recreational and professional athletes, and I definitely recommend using lighter weights at a higher rep from time to time if you engage in any type of sport.\n<h3>High Repetition Workout Explained</h3>\nIt’s generally accepted that a low rep range (five reps max) is ideal for building strength, while 6-12 reps builds mass. Anything above that is typically considered endurance work. While I’m more of a low volume workout type of guy, I do enjoy higher volume training every now and then just for the sake of giving my muscles a workout it’s not as accustomed to.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTWJggx_nGQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nThe frequency of a high repetition workout depends on your goal. If you’re primarily trying to build muscle, then I recommend keeping most workouts within the high to mid-rep range with an occasional high volume training thrown in, perhaps once every two to three weeks.<a href=\"/2015/11/27131113/Fotolia_51273904_Subscription_Monthly_L-e1448647891525.jpg\"><img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/11/27131113/Fotolia_51273904_Subscription_Monthly_L-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"benefits of muscular endurance\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n\nOn the other hand, if you’re engaged in some type of sport, then incorporate high-rep training more frequently, perhaps twice a week. I also recommend emphasizing on the muscle that’s used for your given sport. If you’re a recreational kayaker, for instance, then you should be performing a lot of back exercises like rows to simulate the motions of rowing a pair of paddles.\n\nRegardless of your sport, though, I highly recommend performing squats. Squats work the lower body, which consists of the biggest muscle groups. As such, using a lighter weight that enables you to hit failure at around 20 plus reps will without a doubt build amazing lung power. Being able to move and physically put your body under strain for prolonged periods is vital for excelling in most sports.\n<h3>High Reps Still Builds Muscle</h3>\nThe consensus is that high volume training does not build mass. However, one <a href=\"http://muscleevo.net/how-to-build-muscle-with-high-reps/\">study</a> does seem to show that muscle growth is possible when employing high volume training. The research showed that participants that performed leg extensions using a light weight for 30-40 reps made just as much muscle gains in their quads as a group that used a much higher weight at 10-12 reps.\n\nOf course, this is just one study, but it does show that, contrary to popular wisdom, high volume training also stimulates muscle growth to some degree. With this in mind, don’t think you have to sacrifice muscle growth for the sake of increasing muscular endurance; it’s never all one or the other.\n<h3>Remember to Train to Failure</h3>\nRegardless of whether you’re performing low or high reps, remember to always train to failure. I can’t stress this enough; even if you’re more interested in the endurance aspect rather than packing on mass, you still need to train to the point where your muscles can’t do another rep. Otherwise, you’re not reaping the benefits of muscular endurance that you seek.\n\n<strong>The photo below was sent in by a student of mine.

To get your abs to show, you have to burn off the layers of unsightly fat; that’s a given. However, most people aren’t aware that not all fats are created equal. In fact, fat actually falls into two categories: visceral and subcutaneous. This article will focus on the former and show you how to lose visceral fat.\n<h3>Visceral Vs Subcutaneous Fat</h3>\nMost people have that “inch you can pinch” just above their waistline. It’s the part of the belly with the handful of body fat that you can grab with your hand or pinch with your fingers depending on how much you got that’s covering your abs. This is subcutaneous fat and is located between the skin and muscle. The flab that women tend to accumulate around their thighs and upper arms is also subcutaneous fat.\n\nVisceral fat, on the other hand, is located deeper within the body with most of it deposited around your organs. Obviously, this fat type is less apparent. It's also a bit firmer and less soft or jelly-like. For this reason, you may think that subcutaneous fat is what you need to focus on shedding. Visceral fat, however, also contributes to a wider girth. In addition, it also has other implications besides increasing the perimeter of your waistline.\n<h3>Visceral Fat Is a Health Destroyer</h3>\nSome visceral fat is necessary for everyday bodily functions. Too much of it, though, can wreak havoc on your health. Fat, you see, is not just a bunch of cells that store calories; it’s actually comprised of living tissue that releases hormones that disrupts normal body rhythms. High visceral fat levels have been linked to common ailments, such as Type 2 Diabetes, high LDL cholesterol, hypertension, and increased insulin resistance.\n\nWatch this video for a deeper explanation of what visceral fat is and why too much of it is hazardous for your health.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ymsj3nF2EjM\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Determining Your Visceral Fat Levels</h3>\nThere’s no way of determining your levels of visceral fat short of a pricey CT scan. You can, however, get a general idea and know whether your visceral fat stores are at unhealthy levels. All you need to do is measure your waist using a tape measure. Position the tape at navel level and circle it around the tummy to obtain your measurement. Repeat this three times to acquire the average sum of your waist measurement. When wrapping the tape, don’t cheat by sucking in your stomach.\n\nMeasurements should ideally be under 40 and 35-inches for men and women respectively. Visceral fat tends to accrue in the midsection, so if your measurements are above these numbers, then you likely have excess levels. Don’t worry, though, learning how to lose visceral fat doesn’t require reinventing of the wheel.\n<h3>Shedding Visceral Fat</h3>\nThere’s no fat loss method that specifically targets visceral as opposed to subcutaneous fat. You should make a wholehearted effort, though, to cut down on simple sugars and alcohol, since calories from these substances tend to be stored as visceral fat. Of course, these are foods you should be cutting back on anyways. Keep your protein intake high and maintain an exercise routine that consists of a mix of strength training and high intensity cardio.\n\nOn top of your regimen, I recommend that you supplement with a thermogenic fat burner like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme\">Tea Rexx</a>. It contains proven ingredients for speeding up your metabolism and burning calories from both visceral and subcutaneous fat.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Who doesn’t want a firm, rock-hard midsection?

You can, however, get a general idea and know whether your visceral fat stores are at unhealthy levels. All you need to do is measure your waist using a tape measure. Position the tape at navel level and circle it around the tummy to obtain your measurement. Repeat this three times to acquire the average sum of your waist measurement. When wrapping the tape, don’t cheat by sucking in your stomach.</p>\n\n<p>Measurements should ideally be under 40 and 35-inches for men and women respectively. Visceral fat tends to accrue in the midsection, so if your measurements are above these numbers, then you likely have excess levels. Don’t worry, though, learning how to lose visceral fat doesn’t require reinventing of the wheel.  </p>\n\n<h3>Shedding Visceral Fat</h3>  \n\n<p>There’s no fat loss method that specifically targets visceral as opposed to subcutaneous fat. You should make a wholehearted effort, though, to cut down on simple sugars and alcohol, since calories from these substances tend to be stored as visceral fat. Of course, these are foods you should be cutting back on anyways. Keep your protein intake high and maintain an exercise routine that consists of a mix of strength training and high intensity cardio.</p>\n\n<p>On top of your regimen, I recommend that you supplement with a thermogenic fat burner like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme\">Tea Rexx</a>. It contains proven ingredients for speeding up your metabolism and burning calories from both visceral and subcutaneous fat.</p>","amp":null,"image":"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/12/DSC08883.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-11-30 11:00:32","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-11-30 11:00:32","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-11-30 11:00:32","published_by":1},{"id":2246,"uuid":"d065ad8d-f9f9-4788-bf81-4d3ebdd3676b","title":"The Best Exercises for Losing Stomach Fat and Sculpting Your Abs","slug":"the-best-exercises-for-losing-stomach-fat-and-sculpting-your-abs","markdown":"By now I’m sure most of you have seen my regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/HighLifeWorkout\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube videos</a>. In many of those, I take viewers through some of my routines, which often includes ab exercises. This isn’t all I did to forged my rock hard abs, though. My six-pack is also a result of dieting, strength training, and HIIT. What then, are the best exercises for losing stomach fat?\n<h3>The Big 3</h3>\nIn bodybuilding, there is a term famously referred as the Big 3. Basically, this refers to three exercises: squats, bench presses, and deadlifts. These three exercises are considered the best foundational movements for building mass due to the multiple muscles they recruit and the amount of weight they enable a lifter to use. Here’s the thing: these exercises also burn massive calories, thus helping you burn fat while you build muscle.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/01174349/How-to-Naturally-Maintain-Peak-Testosterone-Levels-After-You-Turn-40-7.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/01174349/How-to-Naturally-Maintain-Peak-Testosterone-Levels-After-You-Turn-40-7-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Male Fitness Athlete Lifting Deadlift In The Gym\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n\nWhen I’m in the gym, the Big 3 are actually the exercises I hardly see people doing. Those that do perform them often use a laughingly light weight and/or end the set clearly before they reached failure.\n\nThe Big 3 will only work their magic when you go heavy and to absolute failure. Yes, it’s going to hurt, but muscles are stubborn and will only get bigger if you show them that you mean business. Bigger muscles translate to more fat loss since muscles require additional calorie expenditure.\n<h3>Use Free Weights</h3>\nWhen doing any of the Big 3, I highly recommend sticking to a traditional barbell. Forget about alternatives like cable machines or a smith machine where the bar is fixed to a rack. Free weights force you to use your stabilizer muscles, whereas machines place your body in a fixed plane of motion. This causes the body to move in an unnatural way and in a manner that places undue stress on the body.\n<h3>Sample Big 3 Workout</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Squats</td>\n<td width=\"319\">3-5 sets, 5-6 reps each</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Deadlifts</td>\n<td width=\"319\">3-5 sets, 5-6 reps each</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Bench press</td>\n<td width=\"319\">3-5 sets, 5-6 reps each</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThis seems like a fairly straightforward workout since there are only three exercises. While it is indeed simple, trust me when I say that there is nothing easy about it. This workout will have you sweating like a pig and panting heavily. If executed in this manner and to failure with each set, however, then muscle gains and fat loss is guaranteed.\n\nI recommend doing the exercises in the order listed. While you may reverse the order of the bench press and deadlifts, I advise keeping squats as the first exercise. You’ll need the most energy for it due to the movement targeting the largest muscles in the body.\n\nYou may also add an isolation exercise or two after completing the Big 3, though it’s not necessary. The Big 3 alone is sufficient for enormous muscle gains and blow torching fat.\n<h3>What About Cardio?</h3>\nThe best exercises for losing stomach fat also include cardio. I have plenty of <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/html5-blank/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">HIIT cardio videos</a> you can check out. Below is one of them.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCVTPfBxG7k\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nYou don’t have to solely do HIIT. There are other alternatives, such as sprinting, running on a hill, jump roping, or cardio kickboxing. Whatever you do, it should be at a high enough intensity where you are struggling for breath by the time you’re finished, which should be within 20 minutes or less with very few and short rests in between.\n<h3>That’s all There Is to It</h3>\nCheck out my program <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a> for more information.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>By now I’m sure most of you have seen my regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/HighLifeWorkout\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube videos</a>.

This article will show you how to get rid of that excess stomach fat for good.</h3>\nLosing excess stomach fat is an issue, especially for men who tend to accrue fat in their midsection. With women, the fat gain is more spread throughout their body, hence the cottage cheese thighs and the flab under their triceps.\n\nNevertheless, both genders have to put up with fat around their gut that covers up the sexy toned abs that just lurks beneath.\n\nFear not, though, with a commitment to follow a steady diet and exercise plan, that ugly stomach fat will melt off in no time.\n<h3>Be Selective About Where You Get Your Carbs</h3>\nExercising hard is no excuse to eat whatever you want! You get one cheat day a week where you can freely indulge on your favorite foods. The other six days, however, you have to eat for muscle building and fat burning.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/02131115/Fotolia_65706597_Subscription_XXL.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/02131115/Fotolia_65706597_Subscription_XXL-300x196.jpg\" alt=\"Composition of various exotic fruits isolated on white background\" width=\"300\" height=\"196\" /></a>\n\nThe first I want to discuss is carbs. Most of you know the difference between simple and complex carbs.\n\nHere’s the deal: at least 80% of your total carb intake should come from complex sources, this means foods like oatmeal, brown rice, and whole wheat bread.\n\nFruits, while they contain sugar, may fall within this 80% due to their high nutritional value. Plus, most also come with a good heaping of fiber.\n\nThe remaining 20% leaves for a bit of wiggle room to consume simple carbs. Most of this 20% should be consumed during breakfast or before or after workout.\n\nThe reason refined carbs and sugar is bad news is because they are composed of glucose and fructose. The latter can only be metabolized by the liver in certain amounts. Consume more than your liver can handle and the rest will be stored as fat, most of it going right to your stomach.\n<h3>Consume Plenty of Fiber</h3>\nAlso be sure to consume plenty of vegetables and leafy greens, which contain high doses of viscous fiber. This type of fiber binds to water and forms a gel-like substance that “sits” in the stomach. The substance slows digestion and nutrient absorption, which creates a feeling of fullness.\n\nViscous fiber, therefore, acts as an appetite suppressant.\n\nWhat’s more, a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856431/\">five-year study</a> showed that subjects who consumed at least 10 grams of viscous fiber a day had 3.7% less fat in their abdominal section.\n<h3>Eat More Protein</h3>\nGetting more protein is perhaps the single most effective dietary change you can make for losing excess stomach fat.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/02131243/The-Ultimate-Testosterone-Grocery-List-38-Foods-to-Boost-Your-T-Levels-4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/02131243/The-Ultimate-Testosterone-Grocery-List-38-Foods-to-Boost-Your-T-Levels-4-300x215.jpg\" alt=\"Cut jerky on a wooden cooking board.\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" /></a>\n\nThis <a href=\"http://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-7075-9-5\">study</a> shows that <strong>protein has an inverse relation to belly fat</strong>.

Any muscle you gain will aid in the fat loss process since muscle requires calories to maintain even when at rest.\n\nBy strength training, though, I’m talking about compound movements like heavy squatting and deadlifts, so don’t wuss out by sticking to bicep curls and bodyweight sit-ups.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6enxh0QwdLs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Be Sure to Do HIIT Cardio</h3>\nAside from strength training, you also have to get in aerobic activity. My definition of “cardio,” however, does not mean 30 minutes on a treadmill at a moderate pace.\n\n<strong>Here’s the problem with traditional cardio</strong>: sure, it burns calories and fat, but the amount is too small to be of any significance.\n\nWhen you perform cardio and exert maximum intensity for a short period, as is the case with sprinting or HIIT, your body immediately depletes its energy stores, which requires it to tap into its reserves.\n\nIn this case, the energy reserves include stored glycogen, blood glucose, free fatty acids, and intramuscular fat.

In the research, <strong>subjects that followed an isometric routine saw a 12.4% average mass increase after 10 weeks.</strong>\n<h3>Isometric Exercises</h3>\nThere’s no shortage of isometric varieties you can employ into your workout. Some of the more well-known exercises include the plank and wall chair.\n\nMost of them actually include regular exercises that you already do. To execute the isometrics version, you remain in a static position with your body at the mid-point of the movement.\n\nFor example, if you were doing pushups to exercise your chest, then you would hold your body still when it’s at the point between the starting and bottom position.\n\nIsometric exercises can be done using only your bodyweight, with weights, resistance bands, or with machines.\n\n<strong>Example Workout</strong>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">legs</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Wall chair</td>\n<td width=\"213\">3 sets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">chest</td>\n<td width=\"213\">bench press (hold bar at halfway point)</td>\n<td width=\"213\">3 sets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">back</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Pullups or lat pulldowns (pause at halfway position)</td>\n<td width=\"213\">3 sets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">shoulders</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Lateral raise (hold dumbbells with arms at 45 degrees or parallel with floor)</td>\n<td width=\"213\">3 sets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">biceps</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Preacher curls (hold bar at halfway position)</td>\n<td width=\"213\">3 sets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">abs</td>\n<td width=\"213\">plank</td>\n<td width=\"213\">3 sets</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nAs with conventional weight training, keep the rest period between sets brief, preferably no more than a minute.\n\nAlso notice that I didn’t specify a time duration for each set. That’s because there is no specific duration; you just continue to hold the position until your body fails.\n\nIt’s <strong>just as important</strong> that you train to failure in an isometric workout as you do in a typical strength training regimen.\n<h3>Combine Isometrics With Your Normal Routine</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/02134853/Fotolia_92856374_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/02134853/Fotolia_92856374_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x208.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup of women couple training hard over steppers in aerobic class on a fitness center.

It’s a great way to put an exclamation point to an already sweat-busting workout.\n<h3>Your Limits Will Be Tested</h3>\nI must warn you right now that an isometric workout is no joke. Your threshold for pain will be tested.\n\nRemember, though, <strong>you have to train to failure</strong>; if you stop when you know you could’ve held the position for another five seconds or so, then you just cheated yourself out of becoming stronger.\n\n<em>Here’s an idea to consider</em>: if your muscles did not quiver when you ended the set, then you did not train to failure.\n\nWhen you reach the point where your muscles are trembling, use your mental fortitude to hold the position for just another five seconds. When the five seconds are up (it can feel like an eterminty), push yourself to go another five, and then another until your muscles involuntarily give out.\n\nBelieve me, you will be hurting during those last few seconds...\n\n<strong>This is why I recommend taking <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\">Rebellion</a></strong>.

Here is how you can workout from home and get amazing results...</h3>\nFor some people, a gym membership is out of the question. That’s okay; You really don’t need a gym full of state-of-the-art equipment anyways.\n\nIn this post, Ill show you how to work out at home even if you have limited space and can only afford basic equipment.\n<h3>Invest in Equipment</h3>\nI recommend that you set aside space solely for your workout. You don’t need a whole lot of room; half of the garage or a portion of the patio would suffice.\n\nAs far as equipment goes, here’s what I recommend:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Squat rack</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>Adjustable bench</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>Barbell and dumbbells with adjustable plates</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>Dip station with pullup bar</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/06154635/Fotolia_76500654_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"fitness center with equipment\" width=\"290\" height=\"193\" />The equipment listed is all you need for a complete body workout. You will be able to perform most of the exercises you can do at a gym.\n\nYeah, I know buying everything on the list can be a bit pricey. A squat rack is definitely not cheap and can range anywhere from $100 to $1,000. A dip station is also a bit on the pricey end and generally runs around $100 to $400.\n\nAll in all, you’re looking at an investment of $1,000 at the minimum for all the equipment.\n\nWhile that is definitely not cheap, consider how much the average yearly gym membership cost. I was looking up the 24 Hour Fitness website the other day and just out of curiosity checked its membership offers.\n\nThere were various plans, but the cheapest included a $35 monthly fee plus a $40 initiation fee and an $80 activation fee. That’s $540 for the first year and $460 each year after. With that in mind, all the equipment I listed will pay itself off within 2-4 years.\n<h3>Alternative Solution</h3>\nOf course, I realize the equipment is still too expensive for some. Space is also an issue for apartment dwellers or those who live in really small homes.\n\nIf this is your case, then there are alternative solutions. I still recommend getting a barbell and dumbbell set with adjustable plates at the bare minimum.\n\nYou can get a 100lb set for around $100 and a few additional plates for just under that. The bar and plates don’t take up a whole lot of space. You can even store them under your bed.\n\nYou should also get a door mounted pullup bar, which only runs around $20 to $30. As far as a bench goes, if price is a factor, then you can just get a regular bench without the incline/decline adjustment, which is about $50.\n<h3>Exercises at Home</h3>\nHere’s a list of exercises you can do at home if all you can manage to get are free weights and a pullup bar:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">legs</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Pistol squats, barbell/dumbbell lunges</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">chest</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Dumbbell press on Swiss ball, dumbbell floor press</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">back</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Pullups, bent-over dumbbell rows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">biceps</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Barbell/dumbbell curls, pullups</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">triceps</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Skull crushers, dumbbell overhead extensions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">shoulders</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Dumbbell lateral raises, overhead press</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n\nWith nothing more than a barbell set and a pullup bar, you can get a total body workout and train to failure.\n\nA few other exercises can also be added if you improvise. For your chest and triceps, for example, you can add dips to your workout by using two sturdy chairs placed shoulder width apart.\n\nLikewise, you can perform weighted pushups or pullups by placing some weight plates inside a backpack.\n\nIn addition, you can also add<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/isometric-workouts-for-freaky-strength-and-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\"> isometrics</a>. Say for example that you want to do low volume barbell squats but lack enough weights and/or rack to really go heavy.\n\nYou can still train with maximum intensity by performing a few sets of wall chairs to pre-exhaust your muscles before moving onto squats. With your quads already worn, you'll reach total failure at a low rep range despite using a lighter weight that you can safely lift overhead and get over your shoulders.\n\nOf course, you also need to add cardio into your routine. Fortunately, a typical HIIT session requires zero equipment or can be done with a pair of light to moderate dumbbells.\n\nI have number of quick and effective <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/html5-blank/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">HIIT exercises</a> on my site and youtube page.\n<h3>No Equipment at All? No Worries</h3>\nIt may also be the case that you have zero equipment to work with.

This article will show you how to effectively use your own bodyweight to build muscle</h3><p>Even if you’re like me and prefer weight lifting, there may be times when you need to get a workout but have no equipment..</p><p>Well, let me tell you, even if all you have are the clothes on your back and a few square feet of floor underneath you, it’s still possible to get in a punishing training session..</p><p><h3>Why Train With Your Bodyweight?</h3><p>Many athletes only train with their body. While they may not be all huge and hulked up, they are certainly ripped and shredded..</p><p>Gymnasts are the perfect example. Most of them only utilize bodyweight exercises to perfect movements needed for their routine..</p><p>Just take a look at American gymnasts Jonathan Horton and Paul Hamm; these guys are absolutely ripped to the bone with vein-popping muscles..</p><p>The same can be said about elite soldiers and Marines. Their daily physical fitness routine consists mainly of bodyweight exercises like pushups, which are critical for developing functional strength for the physical rigors of modern warfare..</p><p>\n\t<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nb9xBJ_pvE4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\t<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Correct Way to Train With Zero Equipment</h3><p>When training with your bodyweight, <strong>you need to train the same way as you would with free weights</strong>. This means employing mostly low volume work and reaching failure at each set..</p><p>It is certainly a great display of muscular endurance if you can do 500 bodyweight squats or 50 pushups and upward. However, muscular endurance does not necessarily equal muscle growth.

Most of them only utilize bodyweight exercises to perfect movements needed for their routine..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just take a look at American gymnasts Jonathan Horton and Paul Hamm; these guys are absolutely ripped to the bone with vein-popping muscles..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same can be said about elite soldiers and Marines. Their daily physical fitness routine consists mainly of bodyweight exercises like pushups, which are critical for developing functional strength for the physical rigors of modern warfare..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nb9xBJ_pvE4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;The Correct Way to Train With Zero Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When training with your bodyweight, &lt;strong&gt;you need to train the same way as you would with free weights&lt;/strong&gt;. This means employing mostly low volume work and reaching failure at each set..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is certainly a great display of muscular endurance if you can do 500 bodyweight squats or 50 pushups and upward.

This post is going to show you how I like to implement cardio boxing into my HIIT routine.</h3>\nAs most of you likely already know, I have a soft spot for HIIT-based cardio. I don't normally recommend long distance cardio done at a moderate pace.\n\nIn my opinion, as long as you train at a high intensity that leaves you fighting for every ounce of breath, then you’re on the right track with respects to aerobics. Feel free to change the routine up from time to time.\n\nAdding some cardio boxing workout routines is a great way to push your body to the limit in a different way.\n<h3>How to Do It</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/10110044/Fotolia_83088016_Subscription_Monthly_XL-e1449521433276.jpg\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/10110044/Fotolia_83088016_Subscription_Monthly_XL-e1449521433276-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"fighter training. woman punching the boxing heavy bag . concept about sport, fighting and sport\" width=\"227\" height=\"194\" /></a>There’s <strong>two ways</strong> of doing cardio boxing; you can either <strong>hit a heavy bag</strong> (recommended), or <strong>shadow box</strong>, that is, punching and kicking in the air or at an imaginary opponent.\n\nI highly prefer the former because the whole workout just feels so much more satisfying if you actually have a target to hit. Plus, it’s a whole lot more fun.\n\nOf course, if you don’t have access to a heavy bag, then shadow boxing will suffice.\n<h3>A Few Tips for Getting Started</h3>\nHere are a few pointers I recommend for making the most of this type of workout.\n\n<strong>1. Emphasize on Footwork</strong>\n\nThere’s a lot more to boxing than just punching; footwork is just as important. At no point should your feet be planted on the floor.\n\nBe light on the balls of your feet with a slight bouncing motion. Continuously move around the bag as you punch. This makes the exercise more of a total body workout.\n\n<strong>2. Don’t Forget to Kick Also</strong>\n\nI also recommend throwing a few roundhouse kicks. It takes more energy to throw a kick than a punch due to the size of the muscles on the legs. You can also clinch the bag and throw a few knees.\n\n<strong>3. Throw Combinations</strong>\n\nInstead of just throwing a punch here and there, link your strikes. A basic combination is a jab followed by a reverse punch, a hook, and a roundhouse kick. Get creative and change your combos up.\n\n<strong>4. Keep Your Hands Up</strong>\n\nKeeping your hands up at all times is boxing 101. Keeping your hands up when your arms are getting tired from all those punches also builds muscular endurance in the biceps, triceps, and shoulders.\n\nWhen punching or kicking, the non-striking hand or hands should be at chin level to protect your jaw.\n\nThe techniques outlined are basic drills boxers and MMA fighters perform on a routine basis. Of course, you’re doing cardio boxing to burn fat, not to get ready for a match.\n\nHowever, the points listed do force you to move a lot more, thus helping you exert a little more energy and therefore burn more calories.\n<h3>Cardio Boxing Routine</h3>\nI outline a basic routine in the video below. It’s easy to follow; just attack a heavy bag or shadow box at 100% for 30 seconds. Rest for 30 seconds and repeat. Shoot for a total of eight to 10 rounds.\n\n<em>Remember to apply all the points I listed during your 30 second rounds.</em>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LHnQMMevalg?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<strong>Tip:</strong> Here’s a challenge to throw into the workout that will push you even more...\n\nDuring each round, perform two or three burpees. After every one or two combinations, immediately take a shuffle step back and quickly sprawl to the floor for a burpee.\n\nThe quick sprawling and jumping requires an explosive burst of energy and will have you breathing even harder. If this is too much for you, then just add the burpee in the first two or three rounds.\n<h3>Add Cardio Boxing to Give Body Fat the One-Two Punch</h3>\nCardio boxing workout routines are challenging but also a lot of fun. Plus, the very act of repeatedly pounding on an object in front of you is a good way to relieve some pent up stress.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Before an intense cardio session, I like to take a serving of <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion\">Rebellion</a>, and I recommend you do the same.

This is true for both muscle gains and fat loss. After a period of initial success, the results all of a sudden come to an abrupt standstill.\n\nAt that point, it begins to feel like you’re training only to maintain whatever results you were able to gain before the plateau reared its ugly head.\n\nWell, I am about to show you how to break free from a cardio plateau so you can get back to seeing amazing results.\n<h3>1. Change Exercises</h3>\nFollowing the same routine day in and out is the surefire way to hit a plateau. This is why <strong>I recommend changing your exercises every four weeks</strong> or so.\n\nYou can maintain a HIIT routine while changing the exercises. If one of the movements involve 30 seconds of crunches, for example, then consider swapping it out with a 30 second isometric plank.\n\nGive your routine a complete overhaul. This creates what is known as muscle confusion, in which your muscles are all of a sudden hit with a different type of training that it’s not accustomed to. It responds by adapting and growing as a result. The same principle applies for fat loss as well.\n<h3>2. Increase Intensity</h3>\nMore intensity means more calories burned. Intensity can be ramped up by increasing reps, duration, or using more resistance.\n\nWhen it comes to cardio, and HIIT specifically, you can decrease rest time. If each rest period is typically 30 seconds, then gradually decrease it to 25 seconds, then 20.\n\nOf course, you can add more resistance as well. If one exercise involves deep knee bends, then increase intensity by holding a weight plate or pair of dumbbells. You can also combine more resistance with shorter rest periods.\n\nIn any case, I do not recommend extending overall workout duration. The longer it’s drawn out, the more your body will hold back to preserve its energy to make it through the whole routine.\n<h3>3. Change It Up Altogether</h3>\nInstead of just changing exercises within the same workout, consider changing the entire training regimen. There are viable alternatives besides a typical HIIT session.<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/07170059/Fotolia_89887838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-279x300.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_89887838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL\" width=\"239\" height=\"257\" />\n\nSome other routines I have tried include cardio kickboxing, hill sprints with a weighted vest, and jump roping with a heavy rope. However you change it up, it is critical that you maintain the same level of intensity.\n\nIf your typical HIIT session is 15 minutes, then your new workout should also completely leave your gas tank empty within that time frame.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/html5-blank/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to check out some of my intense HIIT workouts. These 10-20 minute workouts are no joke, so be ready to work! </strong>.</p><p>\n\n<h3>“Shock” Your Body Into Losing Fat</h3>\nThe body has what can be best described as a “comfort zone.” This is the level of muscle and body fat that the body is naturally inclined to maintain.\n\nEveryone’s comfort zone is different depending on their genetics. Some people’s bodies tend to hold onto more body fat, while a gifted few can maintain low body fat percentages with relative ease.\n\nThe point is that once your body is in its comfort zone, <strong>the remaining fat will be really stubborn</strong> and won’t melt off unless you “<em>shock</em>” your body.\n\nBy <em>shocking your body</em>, I mean taking it out of its comfort zone by giving it something entirely new or increasing intensity to a point where it knows you aren’t playing around.\n<h3>Have a Solution for Every Plateau</h3>\nBe sure to check out <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Below is a transformation by one of my students.

Some people’s bodies tend to hold onto more body fat, while a gifted few can maintain low body fat percentages with relative ease.</p>\n\n<p>The point is that once your body is in its comfort zone, <strong>the remaining fat will be really stubborn</strong> and won’t melt off unless you “<em>shock</em>” your body.</p>\n\n<p>By <em>shocking your body</em>, I mean taking it out of its comfort zone by giving it something entirely new or increasing intensity to a point where it knows you aren’t playing around.  </p>\n\n<h3>Have a Solution for Every Plateau</h3>  \n\n<p>Be sure to check out <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Below is a transformation by one of my students.

Here is how you can incorporate them into your workout routine...</h3>\nWorking out doesn't just have to be about achieving a lean and mean physique. If you’re an athlete, then training for performance is extremely important, and it can still help you achieve your aesthetic goals.\n\nEven if you just want to drop a few pounds, I recommend some speed workout drills for increasing agility, stamina, and muscular endurance. Many speed workouts are also a great way to change up your routine if you need a little deviation from your conventional training.\n\nBelieve me, these workouts are every bit as challenging and can be incorporated into your HIIT routine.\n\nHere are a few exercises to prime your body for cheetah-like speed.\n<h3>1. Weave in Weave Out</h3>\nPlace four cones in a straight line and about three yards apart. In between each cone, place another cone three yards to the left. Sprint from one cone to the next, kneeling just enough to place your hand on the cone before quickly proceeding to the next.\n\nThis is an excellent exercise for developing lateral movement.\n<h3>2. Single-Leg Bounds</h3>\nBalancing on one leg, push off that leg and land on the opposite foot. As soon as the foot lands, begin the next rep without pause. This exercise develops “push-off” power while developing strength in the calf muscles.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wBYb62P7Jo?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>3. Arm Postures</h3>\nThe movement of the arms is just as important as the legs when running. To condition the arms for proper posture, bend the elbows at 90 degrees and mimic the movement you would during a run. That is, raise one hand to the cheeks while the other lowers to your hips.\n\nKeep alternating as fast as you can. If you’re just emphasizing on technique, then perform the drill as is. If you want to add a conditioning component to it, then run in place as you do it.\n<h3>4. Suicide Drill</h3>\nDistribute cones across a straight line with each one placed twice as far than the previous (e.g. 3 yards, 6 yards, 12 yard, 24 yards, and so on).\n\nFrom the start point, sprint to the first cone and back to the starting point. Immediately proceed to sprint to the second cone and back to the starting point. Keep sprinting to the next furthest cone every time you return to the starting point.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLdsR0uFKJ4?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>5. Alternating Step-Up</h3>\nWith a sturdy stool or yoga step about six inches high, raise one foot to the step followed by the other. Immediately lower the first foot to the floor followed by the other. Repeat with the other foot stepping up first. Do this as fast as you can, keeping light on the balls of your feet the whole time.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SthDMCPC7ro?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Putting It all Together</h3>\nThe exercises listed above can be incorporated into a HIIT routine, such as in the example workout below:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Weave in Weave Out</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Single-leg bounds</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Arm postures (while running in place)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Suicide drill</td>\n<td width=\"319\"> 30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Alternating step-up</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle 2-3 more times</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThis type of workout will need to be performed outdoors with plenty of open space and preferably on a relatively flat surface. Each exercise also needs to be done as fast as possible while maintaining good form.\n\nIn addition, you can also adjust the duration of each exercise depending on the difficulty of each one.\n\nYou may find, for example, single-leg bounds to be too taxing for you to go for a full 30 seconds especially once you reach the second cycle and beyond. If so, just go for about 20 seconds and distribute those extra 10 seconds to another exercise, such as the alternating step-up.\n<h3>Increase Speed WHILE Burning Fat</h3>\nWhen you make speed workout drills a part of your HIIT routine, <strong>not only do you burn fat but you also condition your muscles for stamina and agility</strong>.

This article is going to show how you can lose that unwanted belly fat for good!</h3>\nFor men especially, the last few inches of belly fat can be really stubborn. It can seem like, no matter what you do, those last few inches just won’t go away.\n\nHere’s the thing about losing gut fat: <strong>there is nothing you can do that directly targets the fat stores around your stomach</strong>.\n\nLook, I get it; we all have those “troubled spots” where the fat just seems to stick around no matter what we do. Spot reducing, however, simply isn’t possible. The only way to get rid of fat once and for all is to incorporate a comprehensive workout and dieting plan.\n<h3>The Proof</h3>\nSpot reduction has long been debunked. Even so, there are many who still hold on hope, believing if they perform those extra set of crunches or leg raises that they’ll finally lose the love handles.\n\nHere’s a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23222084\">study</a> that puts the nail in the coffin for the ludicrous idea of spot reduction.\n\nIn the study, 11 subjects, consisting of both men and women, underwent a training regimen where they trained only one leg on a leg press machine.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, their body mass index was measured. Here’s what researchers found:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Subjects saw a decrease in upper body fat by 10.2%</li>\n \t<li>Total body fat mass decreased by 5.1%</li>\n \t<li>No significant changes in lean body mass</li>\n \t<li><strong>There were no significant changes in lean mass, fat mass, or bone mass in the trained leg </strong></li>\n</ul>\nThe last point is bolded for a reason. It emphasizes that targeting a specific body part does not lead to greater fat loss in that area alone. If spot reducing was real, then the trained leg would have significantly less fat.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQWlkkXz6v0?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>What You Can and Should Do to Lose Gut Fat</h3>\nThe midsection is the troubled area for most people, and I totally get the frustration of not being able to shed the last few inches. However, you got to be smart in your training approach.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> You have to follow a TOTAL body program that includes strength training, cardio, and dieting. <a href=\"http://Thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a> shows you how to do just that.</strong>.</p><p>\nStrength training is absolutely necessary even if you’re not interested in gaining lean muscle. The intense low volume training that I recommend will burn tons of calories and pack on muscle. Muscle, in turn, helps keep you lean by burning additional fat.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/13200126/brandon-looking-left-transparent.png\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/13200126/brandon-looking-left-transparent-259x300.png\" alt=\"brandon-looking left-transparent\" width=\"247\" height=\"287\" /></a>Then there’s cardio...\n\nor my preference, HIIT cardio. If done right, it will force your body into an “emergency state” where it has to rely on your fat stores for additional fuel to keep the body going.\n\nFinally, there is dieting. The only way to lose fat is to eat in a calorie deficit.\n\nYou’re still allotted one cheat day a week; the other six days, however, you have to eat for fat loss.\n\n<strong>Those are three components that all have to be in place for you to see meaningful results</strong>. So many people follow one or two components with absolute dedication but badly falter on the other one or two.\n<h3>There Are no Shortcuts</h3>\nIf it was possible to lose gut fat by targeting that area directly, there would be so much more beach and bikini bodies.\n\nUnfortunately, Science has proven that spot reducing simply isn’t doable.

This article is going to show how you can lose that unwanted belly fat for good!</h3>  \n\n<p>For men especially, the last few inches of belly fat can be really stubborn. It can seem like, no matter what you do, those last few inches just won’t go away.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the thing about losing gut fat: <strong>there is nothing you can do that directly targets the fat stores around your stomach</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Look, I get it; we all have those “troubled spots” where the fat just seems to stick around no matter what we do. Spot reducing, however, simply isn’t possible. The only way to get rid of fat once and for all is to incorporate a comprehensive workout and dieting plan.  </p>\n\n<h3>The Proof</h3>  \n\n<p>Spot reduction has long been debunked. Even so, there are many who still hold on hope, believing if they perform those extra set of crunches or leg raises that they’ll finally lose the love handles.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23222084\">study</a> that puts the nail in the coffin for the ludicrous idea of spot reduction.</p>\n\n<p>In the study, 11 subjects, consisting of both men and women, underwent a training regimen where they trained only one leg on a leg press machine.</p>\n\n<p>After 12 weeks, their body mass index was measured. Here’s what researchers found:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n     <li>Subjects saw a decrease in upper body fat by 10.2%</li>\n     <li>Total body fat mass decreased by 5.1%</li>\n     <li>No significant changes in lean body mass</li>\n     <li><strong>There were no significant changes in lean mass, fat mass, or bone mass in the trained leg </strong></li>\n</ul>  \n\n<p>The last point is bolded for a reason. It emphasizes that targeting a specific body part does not lead to greater fat loss in that area alone. If spot reducing was real, then the trained leg would have significantly less fat.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQWlkkXz6v0?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>  \n\n<h3>What You Can and Should Do to Lose Gut Fat</h3>  \n\n<p>The midsection is the troubled area for most people, and I totally get the frustration of not being able to shed the last few inches. However, you got to be smart in your training approach. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> You have to follow a TOTAL body program that includes strength training, cardio, and dieting. <a href=\"http://Thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a> shows you how to do just that.</strong>.</p><p> <br />\nStrength training is absolutely necessary even if you’re not interested in gaining lean muscle. The intense low volume training that I recommend will burn tons of calories and pack on muscle. Muscle, in turn, helps keep you lean by burning additional fat.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/13200126/brandon-looking-left-transparent.png\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/13200126/brandon-looking-left-transparent-259x300.png\" alt=\"brandon-looking left-transparent\" width=\"247\" height=\"287\" /></a>Then there’s cardio...</p>\n\n<p>or my preference, HIIT cardio. If done right, it will force your body into an “emergency state” where it has to rely on your fat stores for additional fuel to keep the body going.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there is dieting. The only way to lose fat is to eat in a calorie deficit.</p>\n\n<p>You’re still allotted one cheat day a week; the other six days, however, you have to eat for fat loss.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Those are three components that all have to be in place for you to see meaningful results</strong>. So many people follow one or two components with absolute dedication but badly falter on the other one or two.  </p>\n\n<h3>There Are no Shortcuts</h3>  \n\n<p>If it was possible to lose gut fat by targeting that area directly, there would be so much more beach and bikini bodies.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Science has proven that spot reducing simply isn’t doable. With that in mind, keep your focus on long-term results; know that the pot belly of yours will eventually slim down as long as you follow the type of training and dieting advice that I have in my posts and programs. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Check out this transformation from one of my students...</strong>.</p><p> <br />\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/09170055/11223658_10207482811694245_1441566029434441516_n-e1449517263703.jpg\" alt=\"11223658_10207482811694245_1441566029434441516_n\" /> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>He was able to accomplish his goals following the philosophies and tactics I talk about in my program <a href=\"http://Thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>.

However, this doesn't need to be the case. You can get a killer workout in even if you only have 5 minutes.</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nI’ll put it out there right now: there is ALWAYS enough time for you to get in your workout. If you anticipate a busy day the next day, then plan ahead and wake up half an hour earlier.\n\nOf course, there are times when you are bombarded with work and family commitments that appear out of the blue. I fully understand that there are times when you are extremely pressed for time.\n\nEven so, I would imagine that you can spare at least five minutes for a workout. Yes, <strong>there are 5-minute workouts that you can do that target the whole body.</strong>\n<h3>5-Minute Workout Explained</h3>\nLet me make something clear: 5-minute workouts should be your last resort for those days when your schedule is absolutely crammed.\n\nYou cannot build a rock-hard physique exercising only five minutes a day. They are, however, sufficient as a “once in a while” workout routine when you have no time to kill.\n<h3>Workout Routines</h3>\nHere’s a quick routine you can do in five minutes provided you have equipment or access to a gym.\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Squats</td>\n<td width=\"319\">5-6 reps, 2 sets, 30 second rest in between</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Bench/dumbbell press</td>\n<td width=\"319\">5-6 reps, 1 set</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Deadlifts</td>\n<td width=\"319\">5-6 reps, 1 set</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThis workout should take about five minutes, though it may go slightly over. All the equipment and weights will need to be set up beforehand because the minute you complete one exercise, you’re immediately moving onto the next.\n\n<strong>Since you’re only doing 1-2 sets each exercise, you need to really make them count by going to absolute failure. </strong>\n\nAs you probably noticed, the exercises are also all compound movements. With only five minutes, there’s no time to waste on isolation exercises.\n\nOf course, this workout requires a gym with equipment that needs to be set up before you begin the exercise. If you can only work out for five minutes, then you probably don’t have the time to spare to drive to a gym and set up a squat and bench rack.\n\nFor this reason, a<strong> 5-minute, bodyweight-only workout may be more feasible</strong> in this situation. In this case, give this workout a try:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Alternating pistol squats</td>\n<td width=\"319\">10-12 reps each leg, 2 sets, 30 second rest in between</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Pushups (any variation to reach failure within 10-12 reps)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">10-12 reps, 1-2 sets, 30 second rest in between</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Pullups</td>\n<td width=\"319\">However much you can do, 1-2 sets, 30 seconds rest in between</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nLike with the previous workout, you are zipping from one exercise to the next, which should be much easier to do given that you can do this in your own home and no equipment is required besides a pullup bar.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Similar workouts can also be found in my <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/bodyweight-blast/\">Bodyweight Blast</a> program.</strong>.</p><p>\n\n<h3>What About Cardio?</h3>\nMost of <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/html5-blank/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">my HIIT videos</a> comprise of a 15-20 minute workout. There really is no reason why you can’t squeeze in 15 minutes. If for some reason you don’t have that length of time, then perform a 5-minute version.\n\nBasically, the workout would look something like this:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Burpees</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">20 second rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Mountain climbers</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">20 second rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Clapping pushups</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">20 second rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>No Excuses</h3>\nIf a whole workout can be done in five minutes, then there are absolutely<strong> no excuses.</strong> If you can’t find five minutes out of your time or wake up five minutes earlier, then you seriously need to reevaluate your lifestyle.\n\nBelieve me, as a personal trainer, my schedule is full of last-minute changes that throw my normal routine array.

This post covers some of the crucial aspects of a well designed fat loss workout program including HIIT, Strength Training, Diet, and Intermittent Fasting</h3>\nIf you want to lose fat, then you need a plan in place. It’s not enough to just do some weight lifting and cardio here and there whenever time allows.\n\nToo many people follow a routine in a half-assed manner and wonder why they hit a plateau. My workout program for losing fat will finally get you on the right track, but you have to be the one to follow through with it and not falter the minute the routine becomes boring, inconvenient, or too challenging.\n<h3>HIIT Cardio Is a Must</h3>\nHIIT cardio is ideal because it <strong>directly targets your fat stores.</strong>\n\nMany people opt instead to perform traditional cardio, such as a brisk jog on the treadmill or using the Stairmaster at a hardly challenging speed. When you do cardio in this manner, you will lose some fat in the process but sacrifice muscle as well.\n\nHave you ever heard of the term “skinny fat?” This is a type of look that men are especially prone to when they do a lot of traditional cardio with little to no strength training.\n\nHIIT cardio is super intense, but it’s that intensity that forces your body to tap into its fat stores for energy reserves. I’m not going to lie and tell you that HIIT is a fun workout because – believe me – you’re not having fun when you feel like your heart is going to explode.\n\nWhat you’re doing, however, is creating an optimal thermogenesis environment where your fat cells gradually deflate as the triglycerides inside them are burned for energy.\n<h3>Strength Training</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12114745/10-Ways-to-Naturally-Cure-Your-Erectile-Dysfunction-5.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3345\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12114745/10-Ways-to-Naturally-Cure-Your-Erectile-Dysfunction-5-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Bicep exercise\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>You still need to do some form of resistance training if you’re trying to lose fat.\n\n<strong>This should be a mix of weight lifting and bodyweight training from my <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/bodyweight-blast/\">Bodyweight Blast</a> program</strong>.\n\nAnaerobic training helps preserve mass when you’re cutting. When you’re at the gym, you need to train with the same intensity as if you were training for muscle growth. As always, use low volume and lift until you physically cannot do another rep.\n<h3>Dieting</h3>\nThis is the component where people screw up the most. Time and again, I have seen people put their heart and soul into their cardio and strength training workout, only to throw all the hard effort away by eating whatever they want.\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/03221229/4590408656_bc88b92fb5_b.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3152\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/03221229/4590408656_bc88b92fb5_b-300x203.jpg\" alt=\"4590408656_bc88b92fb5_b\" width=\"300\" height=\"203\" /></a>If you have been reading my posts, then you know the deal: <strong>a protein-rich diet, limited carb intake, and drastically reducing simple sugars.</strong> Rinse and repeat six days a week with a cheat day thrown in as a reward for your hard work.\n\nAs long as you stick to whole and unprocessed foods, you can personalize your meals however you like; just be sure to stay within your calorie allowance and protein/carb/fat ratio.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> <a href=\"http://Brolabsmealplan.com\">Meal customization</a> is actually something I can assist you with if you’re having difficulty figuring out what belongs in your kitchen and what should remain in the grocery store.</strong>.</p><p>\n\n<h3>Weekly Sample Plan</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Monday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">HIIT</td>\n<td width=\"213\">2,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Tuesday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Strength training, HIIT</td>\n<td width=\"213\">2,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Wednesday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Rest</td>\n<td width=\"213\">2,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Thursday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">HIIT</td>\n<td width=\"213\">1,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Friday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Strength training, HIIT</td>\n<td width=\"213\">2,500 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Saturday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">HIIT</td>\n<td width=\"213\">2,000 calories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"213\">Sunday</td>\n<td width=\"213\">Rest</td>\n<td width=\"213\">2,500-3,000 calories (cheat day)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThere are a few notes I need to make about this workout plan:\n<ol>\n \t<li>The number of calories listed is for males. For women, consume 500 calories less each day.</li>\n \t<li>On the days where you do both strength training and HIIT, you have two options: do HIIT first thing in the morning (before breakfast) or immediately after your strength training.</li>\n</ol>\nIn the morning, your body has undergone at least an 8-hour fast (assuming you get 8 hours of sleep as you should be). This means your glycogen stores are at its lowest point.\n\nThis enables the body to <strong>more efficiently burn fat rather than carbohydrates from the foods consumed</strong>. Glycogen stores are also low after a workout since a lot of it has been expended during the strenuous training.\n<h3>Intermittent Fasting</h3>\nYou may have also noticed that on Thursday on the workout chart, you’re only consuming 1,500 calories (or 1,000 for women). This is because you’ll also be fasting for the first half of the day.\n\nYou will skip breakfast and the meal after that. You will resume your regular meals starting with lunch. You may fast on your rest day or days that you HIIT. Do not fast on your strength training days.\n<h3>A Final Not About Calories</h3>\nRemember that <strong>you need to be in a calorie deficit when you’re losing fat.</strong> Looking in the mirror alone isn’t enough to know for sure whether you shed any inches. This is why you need to take weekly measurements.\n\nI recommend using a fat caliper first thing in the morning at the start of each week. If the measurements remained the same as last week, then you need to reevaluate your training plan.\n\n<em>Are you holding back when you’re doing HIIT? Are you hitting failure when strength training? Are you sneaking in that chocolate chip cookie when it’s not your cheat day?</em>\n\nIf you wholeheartedly believe that you are giving it your all, then it’s time to cut calories. Reduce your daily intake by about 200-300.\n<h3>It’s More Simple Than It Seems</h3>\nMy workout program for losing fat is really quite simple. Of course, you have to be careful not to equate simple with easy.\n\nMy program requires strict dedication and pushing yourself to the absolute limit when you’re in the gym or doing HIIT. Most of my clients have second-guessed themselves once they’ve committed to my program because the difficulty is more than they bargained for.\n\nHowever, there is not a single client who followed through with my routine that did not see awesome results.

This post will show you how I like to implement circuit training into my routine.</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nCircuit training has long been used by athletes for boosting muscular endurance. It’s also a terrific muscle builder that will have you sweating like a pig and shedding the excess fat in no time.\n\nIntense circuit workouts really aren’t a whole lot different than HIIT. Of course, in most of <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/html5-blank/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">my HIIT videos</a>, there is a 20-30 second rest between exercises.\n\nWith circuit training done my way, there is <strong>no rest in between sets</strong> other than the time it takes for you to transition from one exercise to the next.\n<h3>Does Circuit Training Work?</h3>\nAccording to this <a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/fulltext/2013/05000/high_intensity_circuit_training_using_body_weight_.5.aspx\">study</a>, high-intensity circuit training utilizing bodyweight exercises <strong>raised metabolism and kept it elevated</strong> for 72 hours after workout.\n\nIt’s also believed this manner of training helps burn subcutaneous fat due to the elevated presence of growth hormones and catecholamines secreted during training.\n\nIn this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21659889\">study</a>, circuit strength training was tested against traditional weight lifting. After eight weeks, the circuit training group made similar strength and muscle gains compared to the regular weight training group.\n\nThe former, however, experienced a<strong> greater average fat loss.</strong>\n<h3>Sample Cardio Circuit Training</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Burpees</td>\n<td width=\"319\">45 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Squat box jumps</td>\n<td width=\"319\">45 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Mountain climbers</td>\n<td width=\"319\">45 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Donkey kicks</td>\n<td width=\"319\">45 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle x2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThe entire workout only takes nine minutes, but it is absolutely brutal since you are going nonstop for the whole duration.\n\nIf this is too challenging for you, then incorporate short rest periods between cycles. Try adding a 30 second rest period after each cycle.\n\nIf that’s still too much, then add 15-20 second rests between exercises. The end goal, though, is to be able to perform the entire workout with zero rest.\n<h3>Sample Strength Circuit Training</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Squats</td>\n<td width=\"319\">5-6 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Deadlifts</td>\n<td width=\"319\">5-6 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Bench Press</td>\n<td width=\"319\">5-6 reps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle x3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThis is a simple yet effective strength circuit training workout that makes good use of compound exercises.\n\nOnce again, if this workout is too challenging, then add brief resting periods in between cycles and/or exercises. You may also throw in an isolation exercise or two if you wish, but never use them as a replacement for the compound movements listed.\n\n<strong>On a final note</strong>, you can also combine the sample strength and cardio circuit training into one workout.\n\n<img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/12/14170046/IMG_8305-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8305\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />As I have mentioned in previous posts, it is perfectly acceptable to perform HIIT immediately following your strength training.\n\nYou can do the same here by starting your cardio circuit training right after finishing the strength circuit workout. Just be aware that this is super intense and should be something that you ease into.\n<h3>Add Circuit Training to Your Repertoire</h3>\nIntense circuit workouts will show you the true meaning of a punishing workout. The good news, though, is that you will see results. You will also save time since the sessions are shorter due to the lack of rest time.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Due to the intense nature of such workouts, I recommend that you take a serving of <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\">Rebellion</a> before beginning circuit training. </strong>.</p><p>\nAll of the ingredients are scientifically proven, and will give you that extra push for when your body is in the brink of giving out.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Circuit training is a great way to increase the intensity of your workouts.

After eight weeks, the circuit training group made similar strength and muscle gains compared to the regular weight training group.</p>\n\n<p>The former, however, experienced a<strong> greater average fat loss.</strong>  </p>\n\n<h3>Sample Cardio Circuit Training</h3>  \n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Burpees</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">45 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Squat box jumps</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">45 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Mountain climbers</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">45 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Donkey kicks</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">45 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle x2</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<p>The entire workout only takes nine minutes, but it is absolutely brutal since you are going nonstop for the whole duration.</p>\n\n<p>If this is too challenging for you, then incorporate short rest periods between cycles. Try adding a 30 second rest period after each cycle.</p>\n\n<p>If that’s still too much, then add 15-20 second rests between exercises. The end goal, though, is to be able to perform the entire workout with zero rest.  </p>\n\n<h3>Sample Strength Circuit Training</h3>  \n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Squats</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">5-6 reps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Deadlifts</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">5-6 reps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Bench Press</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">5-6 reps</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle x3</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<p>This is a simple yet effective strength circuit training workout that makes good use of compound exercises.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, if this workout is too challenging, then add brief resting periods in between cycles and/or exercises. You may also throw in an isolation exercise or two if you wish, but never use them as a replacement for the compound movements listed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>On a final note</strong>, you can also combine the sample strength and cardio circuit training into one workout.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/12/14170046/IMG_8305-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8305\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />As I have mentioned in previous posts, it is perfectly acceptable to perform HIIT immediately following your strength training.</p>\n\n<p>You can do the same here by starting your cardio circuit training right after finishing the strength circuit workout. Just be aware that this is super intense and should be something that you ease into.  </p>\n\n<h3>Add Circuit Training to Your Repertoire</h3>  \n\n<p>Intense circuit workouts will show you the true meaning of a punishing workout. The good news, though, is that you will see results. You will also save time since the sessions are shorter due to the lack of rest time. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Due to the intense nature of such workouts, I recommend that you take a serving of <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\">Rebellion</a> before beginning circuit training. </strong>.</p><p> <br />\nAll of the ingredients are scientifically proven, and will give you that extra push for when your body is in the brink of giving out.</p>","amp":null,"image":"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/12/IMG_1743-1.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-12-14 17:00:46","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-12-14 17:00:46","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-12-14 17:00:46","published_by":1},{"id":2260,"uuid":"89b1f168-dd36-4061-9bf3-2986e8b45bc6","title":"Arm Exercises For Fat Loss Around The Triceps; Can It Be Done?","slug":"arm-exercises-for-fat-loss-around-the-triceps-can-it-be-done","markdown":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">People ask me all the time how they can get rid of stubborn fat around their arms.

Aside from the rich and complete protein content, these types of foods also contain a plethora of other nutrients.\n\nIf you’re a vegetarian, upping protein is not that hard since dairy, eggs, and fish can still viable choices, depending on what type of vegetarian you are.\n\nIf you’re a hardcore vegan, then getting in sufficient protein will be tough. Sure, there’s soy protein, but studies have shown that soy elevates estrogen hormones, which encourages the body to store fat.\n\nI truly believe meat and dairy should be a staple in your diet, along with plenty of fruits and vegetables.\n\nSo how much protein do you need? If you’re trying to lose belly fat, then I recommend 40% at a minimum of your daily calorie intake to come from protein.\n\nHere’s a sample diet plan that is super-rich in Protein:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">7:00 am breakfast</td>\n<td width=\"319\">2 scrambled eggs, 1 cup milk, 1 banana</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">10:00 am</td>\n<td width=\"319\">1 cup milk, 1 scoop whey protein,</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">12:30 am lunch</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Salmon or tilapia on wheat bread, sliced vegetables, virgin olive oil dressing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">3:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"319\">1 cup milk, pre-sliced chicken breast or drumsticks, 1 fruit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">6:00 pm dinner</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Lean beef, 2 boiled eggs, sliced vegetables</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">9:00 pm</td>\n<td width=\"319\">1 cup milk, nuts or almonds</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nEvery meal in this chart contains a protein source. There is also very few carbs; in fact, three of the meals don’t even have a carb source at all.\n<h3>Why You Need a Lot of Protein</h3>\nProtein is harder to digest than fat and carbs. The body, therefore, requires more expended effort, resulting in more calorie burn to break the protein down.\n\nProtein also helps the body retain muscle mass, and lean muscle maintenance requires energy expenditure (calorie burning).\n\nIn addition, when you’re on a high-protein eating plan during a weight loss diet, <strong>more of the pounds dropped come from fat as opposed to lean muscle</strong>.\n\nThis was proven in this <a href=\"http://www.fasebj.org/content/27/9/3837.abstract?sid=fbfb86df-7aec-4f10-b8a5-d8092f0f49aa\">study</a> where subjects were divided into the following three eating groups:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Group 1: consumed the recommended daily allowance of protein (.8 grams per kg of body weight).</li>\n \t<li>Group 2: consumed twice the RDA of protein</li>\n \t<li>Group 3: consumed three times the RDA of protein</li>\n</ul>\nAt the end of the 31-day study, all three groups lost roughly the same amount of weight (average 2.7 to 3.5 lbs.).  Group 2, however,<strong> lost the most amount of fat</strong>, comprising about 70% of their weight loss.\n\nGroup 3 was not far behind with about 64% of the weight loss from fat. Group 1, which consumed within the RDA, fared the worst, losing only about 42% of their weight from fat.

Gain Muscle Mass to Lose Fat!","slug":"gain-muscle-mass-to-lose-more-fat","markdown":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Most people want to gain muscle mass and lose fat. This post is going to show you how building muscle will actually help you burn more body fat!</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nImproving your physique is really about accomplishing two things:\n\n<strong>gaining muscle and losing fat</strong>.\n\nMost of my male clients want to do both, while with women it’s almost always about fat loss. Whether you are a man or a woman, gaining muscle mass is one endeavor you should definitely strive after.\n<h3>Why Muscle Mass = Fat Loss</h3>\nI’ve said it many times before, and you also likely heard it from others in the fitness industry: <strong>muscle burns calories</strong>; therefore, the more muscle you have the more fat you burn on a daily basis.\n\nGranted, the additional calories burned aren’t a whole lot, but we’re looking at the long-term basis here where a few calories here and there eventually add up.\n\nThe fact that muscle mass increases metabolism by burning calories is true. Where it gets a little sketchy is the amount of calories muscle actually burns.\n\nThe figures vary, with estimates typically <strong>ranging anywhere from 5 to 100 calories per day</strong> for every pound of muscle mass.\n\nAs a personal trainer, I find the extreme high end to be an over exaggeration. I believe it’s much closer to the lower end at around 5 to 10 calories per 1 pound of muscle.\n\nYes, that sounds negligible, but it really adds up as time goes by.\n\nThere’s a saying in investment that if you put $1 in your piggy bank every day, you will have one million dollars in one million days. Of course, humans don’t live that long, but you get the picture.\n\nThe same holds true for muscle burning fat. Even at the low end of five calories, <strong>you can burn quite an amount of fat in just one year’s time.</strong>\n<h3>Look at the Bigger Picture</h3>\nGaining muscle mass is especially beneficial for men because they can acquire lean muscle at levels that generally aren’t possible for women.\n\nLet's say a guy has 25 lbs of added muscle.\n\nEven if we were very conservative with the estimates and say that they only burn five calories per pound of muscle, that still adds up to a little over one pound of weight loss per month!\n\n<strong>Here is how:</strong>\n\n<em>Calories burned per day (from 25lbs. of muscle): 125</em>\n\n<em>Days in a month: 30</em>\n\n<em>Calories burned in 30 days (30 x 125): 3,750</em>\n\n<em>Number of calories per one pound: 3,200</em>\n\nThat adds up to about 13-14 pounds of fat you lose over a course of 12 months. <strong>Also keep in mind that this fat loss is from the calories that are burned by the added muscle mass. </strong>\n\nIt does not take into consideration the additional calories burned from strength training and HIIT cardio, nor does it take into consideration the calorie deficit of a fat loss diet or the supplementation of a product like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\">Tea Rexx</a>.\n\nIf you factor those in, then you’re looking at even more fat loss.\n<h3>What About Women?</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/15170051/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3329\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/15170051/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Woman on training apparatus in sports club. Fitness\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Obviously, gaining 25 pounds of muscle isn’t realistic for females, and that’s a good thing because most women do not wish to become all hulked up.\n\nEven if they put on, say, seven pounds of muscle within a year, that additional mass still contributes to fat loss over a long-term basis.\n\nThis is why <strong>I strongly insist that women follow a strength training program</strong> and put aside worries of gaining too much muscle.\n<h3>Muscle Gains and Fat Loss Really Complement One Another</h3>\nSure, you can stick solely to HIIT, you will certainly burn fat and become leaner.

Whether you are a man or a woman, gaining muscle mass is one endeavor you should definitely strive after.  </p>\n\n<h3>Why Muscle Mass = Fat Loss</h3>  \n\n<p>I’ve said it many times before, and you also likely heard it from others in the fitness industry: <strong>muscle burns calories</strong>; therefore, the more muscle you have the more fat you burn on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, the additional calories burned aren’t a whole lot, but we’re looking at the long-term basis here where a few calories here and there eventually add up.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that muscle mass increases metabolism by burning calories is true. Where it gets a little sketchy is the amount of calories muscle actually burns.</p>\n\n<p>The figures vary, with estimates typically <strong>ranging anywhere from 5 to 100 calories per day</strong> for every pound of muscle mass.</p>\n\n<p>As a personal trainer, I find the extreme high end to be an over exaggeration. I believe it’s much closer to the lower end at around 5 to 10 calories per 1 pound of muscle.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, that sounds negligible, but it really adds up as time goes by.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a saying in investment that if you put $1 in your piggy bank every day, you will have one million dollars in one million days. Of course, humans don’t live that long, but you get the picture.</p>\n\n<p>The same holds true for muscle burning fat. Even at the low end of five calories, <strong>you can burn quite an amount of fat in just one year’s time.</strong>  </p>\n\n<h3>Look at the Bigger Picture</h3>  \n\n<p>Gaining muscle mass is especially beneficial for men because they can acquire lean muscle at levels that generally aren’t possible for women.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say a guy has 25 lbs of added muscle.</p>\n\n<p>Even if we were very conservative with the estimates and say that they only burn five calories per pound of muscle, that still adds up to a little over one pound of weight loss per month!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here is how:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Calories burned per day (from 25lbs. of muscle): 125</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Days in a month: 30</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Calories burned in 30 days (30 x 125): 3,750</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Number of calories per one pound: 3,200</em></p>\n\n<p>That adds up to about 13-14 pounds of fat you lose over a course of 12 months. <strong>Also keep in mind that this fat loss is from the calories that are burned by the added muscle mass. </strong></p>\n\n<p>It does not take into consideration the additional calories burned from strength training and HIIT cardio, nor does it take into consideration the calorie deficit of a fat loss diet or the supplementation of a product like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\">Tea Rexx</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you factor those in, then you’re looking at even more fat loss.  </p>\n\n<h3>What About Women?</h3>  \n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/15170051/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3329\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/15170051/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Woman on training apparatus in sports club. Fitness\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Obviously, gaining 25 pounds of muscle isn’t realistic for females, and that’s a good thing because most women do not wish to become all hulked up.</p>\n\n<p>Even if they put on, say, seven pounds of muscle within a year, that additional mass still contributes to fat loss over a long-term basis.</p>\n\n<p>This is why <strong>I strongly insist that women follow a strength training program</strong> and put aside worries of gaining too much muscle.  </p>\n\n<h3>Muscle Gains and Fat Loss Really Complement One Another</h3>  \n\n<p>Sure, you can stick solely to HIIT, you will certainly burn fat and become leaner.

This post will teach you how  gaining muscle increases your fat burning potential.</h3>\nSome of my female clients give me a horrified look when I tell them to begin a weight lifting regimen. Obviously, many of them came to me because they want to lose the excess fat around their hips, thighs, and upper arms. Surely, they don’t want to pack on muscle and end up looking like a female Arnold Schwarzenegger?\n\nI can’t even begin to tell you how unfounded this concern is. Woman don't have the ability to put on huge amounts of muscle naturally, however, the added muscle will help you lose additional fat.\n\nUnless women take synthetic testosterone, their bodies do not naturally produce enough androgen for enormous muscle growth.\n\nBut woman aren't the only ones who get the fat burning benefits that weight lifting can provide, men can benefit equally as much!\n<h3>How Weight Lifting Burns Fat</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11882927\">Studies</a> have confirmed that <strong>resistance training increases metabolism</strong>. While the duration varied, some showed that metabolism remained higher than baseline for up to 36 hours after a workout.\n\nOf course, you also burn some calories from the workout itself, though the amount really isn’t all that significant. What matters most is the metabolic rise.\n\nPut it this way: let’s say, for example, that your body burns 50 calories an hour when you’re sedentary. After a weight training session, your metabolism increases and now burns 60 calories an hour.\n\nAn extra 10 calories burned may seem miniscule, but you have to look at the bigger picture. If your metabolism remains elevated for 36 hours, then <strong>that’s an extra 360 calories burned within a day and a half</strong>.\n\nIf you strength train three days a week, that’s a<strong> total of 1,080 calories burned a week</strong>. That’s roughly 1/3 of a pound. That translates to an additional 16 pound weight loss in a year.\n\nIf you perform <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/html5-blank/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">HIIT cardio</a> on top of that, then that adds even more of a metabolic boost.\n\nThere’s more I can go into detail about, but that’s the general idea. For a more detailed explanation, check out this video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7w-PTleKDY?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Wait, There’s More!</h3>\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/18110028/Fotolia_92144958_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3357\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/18110028/Fotolia_92144958_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x227.jpg\" alt=\"Feel that burn! A fit, sporty young woman is sitting in profile on a bench in profile, lifting weights with one hand, while resting her elbow on her knee.\" width=\"300\" height=\"227\" /></a>Remember, you will also gain muscle as a result of the added resistance training.\n\nMen will benefit more here since they will pack on more muscle than their female counterparts. Even women, though, will reap some fat loss benefits.\n\nIt’s estimated that <strong>1lb of muscle burns about 10 calories a day</strong>. Even if you put on only about 5lbs of muscle mass, which is really not a whole lot, that translates to an extra 50 calories burned a day!\n\nAgain, 50 calories seems negligible; that is, until you continuously add it up over a one year period. After 365 days, <strong>those extra 5lbs of muscle helps you burn an additional 18,250 calories</strong>. That comes to about a 5lb weight loss. Combine that with the 16lb you loss from the metabolic increase, that totals 21lb in a year.\n<h3>Weight Lifting = Fat Loss</h3>\nThe figures listed above are actually conservative estimates...\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you follow any of my comprehensive programs, such as my <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>, then you will also be doing plenty of HIIT, not to mention following a detailed diet plan, occasionally fasting, and supplementing with <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\">Tea Rexx</a>.</strong>.</p><p>\nIf you factor all of these into consideration, then you will most likely lose even more fat and keep it off. This is assuming, of course, that you have that much body fat to begin with.\n\nWith all this in mind, it would be crazy to only stick to cardio and never pick up a weight.\n\nThe bottom line: <strong>weight lifting results in fat loss!</strong>\"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Lifting weights is a great way to burn fat.

Woman don't have the ability to put on huge amounts of muscle naturally, however, the added muscle will help you lose additional fat.</p>\n\n<p>Unless women take synthetic testosterone, their bodies do not naturally produce enough androgen for enormous muscle growth.</p>\n\n<p>But woman aren't the only ones who get the fat burning benefits that weight lifting can provide, men can benefit equally as much!  </p>\n\n<h3>How Weight Lifting Burns Fat</h3>  \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11882927\">Studies</a> have confirmed that <strong>resistance training increases metabolism</strong>. While the duration varied, some showed that metabolism remained higher than baseline for up to 36 hours after a workout.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, you also burn some calories from the workout itself, though the amount really isn’t all that significant. What matters most is the metabolic rise.</p>\n\n<p>Put it this way: let’s say, for example, that your body burns 50 calories an hour when you’re sedentary. After a weight training session, your metabolism increases and now burns 60 calories an hour.</p>\n\n<p>An extra 10 calories burned may seem miniscule, but you have to look at the bigger picture. If your metabolism remains elevated for 36 hours, then <strong>that’s an extra 360 calories burned within a day and a half</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If you strength train three days a week, that’s a<strong> total of 1,080 calories burned a week</strong>. That’s roughly 1/3 of a pound. That translates to an additional 16 pound weight loss in a year.</p>\n\n<p>If you perform <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/html5-blank/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">HIIT cardio</a> on top of that, then that adds even more of a metabolic boost.</p>\n\n<p>There’s more I can go into detail about, but that’s the general idea. For a more detailed explanation, check out this video.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7w-PTleKDY?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>  \n\n<h3>Wait, There’s More!</h3>  \n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/18110028/Fotolia_92144958_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3357\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/18110028/Fotolia_92144958_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x227.jpg\" alt=\"Feel that burn! A fit, sporty young woman is sitting in profile on a bench in profile, lifting weights with one hand, while resting her elbow on her knee.\" width=\"300\" height=\"227\" /></a>Remember, you will also gain muscle as a result of the added resistance training.</p>\n\n<p>Men will benefit more here since they will pack on more muscle than their female counterparts. Even women, though, will reap some fat loss benefits.</p>\n\n<p>It’s estimated that <strong>1lb of muscle burns about 10 calories a day</strong>. Even if you put on only about 5lbs of muscle mass, which is really not a whole lot, that translates to an extra 50 calories burned a day!</p>\n\n<p>Again, 50 calories seems negligible; that is, until you continuously add it up over a one year period. After 365 days, <strong>those extra 5lbs of muscle helps you burn an additional 18,250 calories</strong>. That comes to about a 5lb weight loss. Combine that with the 16lb you loss from the metabolic increase, that totals 21lb in a year.  </p>\n\n<h3>Weight Lifting = Fat Loss</h3>  \n\n<p>The figures listed above are actually conservative estimates... <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you follow any of my comprehensive programs, such as my <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">The Simple Shredded Solution</a>, then you will also be doing plenty of HIIT, not to mention following a detailed diet plan, occasionally fasting, and supplementing with <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\">Tea Rexx</a>.</strong>.</p><p> <br />\nIf you factor all of these into consideration, then you will most likely lose even more fat and keep it off. This is assuming, of course, that you have that much body fat to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>With all this in mind, it would be crazy to only stick to cardio and never pick up a weight.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line: <strong>weight lifting results in fat loss!</strong>\"</p>","amp":null,"image":"//media.brandoncarter.com/2015/12/2015-04-21-15.25.17.jpg|http: //2016/01/Pasted-image-at-2016_06_27-07_29-PM.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-12-18 11:00:28","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-12-18 11:00:28","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-12-18 11:00:28","published_by":1},{"id":2268,"uuid":"494cb3e0-2b78-40f7-a5d5-9202158556bc","title":"Foods to Eat to Lose More Fat in Less Time","slug":"foods-to-eat-to-lose-more-fat-in-less-time","markdown":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Calories aren't the only thing that aid in fat loss, food choices can be just as important.

It should be obvious that a cup of oatmeal is not equal to a donut even if the two contain the same calories. This is why you have to be selective with your food choices when it comes to foods for losing fat.\n<h3>What NOT to Eat</h3>\nBefore I take you through my list of superfoods to eat for fat lost, let me tell you what to stay away from.\n\nThere’s no list required here because it’s really quite simple...\n\n<strong>STAY AWAY FROM SIMPLE SUGARS!</strong>\n\nWith the exception of natural fructose from fruits, you should steer clear of any type of sugars. It doesn’t matter if it’s simple table sugar, brown sugar, high fructose corn syrup, cane sugar, or agave syrup. The effect is all the same.\n\nSugar is fattening, period.\n\nUnlike glucose, sugar cannot be metabolized by the body for energy. Instead, sugar is metabolized by the liver where it gets converted into fat and is secreted into the bloodstream where some of it is eventually stored in the cells that make up your subcutaneous fat.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EwqNp9cO_-4?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nIn addition, sugar is also known to make the body resistant to the hormone leptin. Leptin is secreted by fats cells when we eat and is what signals to the brain that the body is full. It is also the hormone that releases fat from fat cells and raises metabolic rate.\n\nI’m not saying you need to avoid sugar entirely. Just limit consumption to your cheat day and for your pre and post-workout meals.\n\nWhen the body becomes leptin-resistant, you feel hungry more often, not to mention your metabolism also slows.\n<h3>What to Add to Your Diet</h3>\nOkay, so you know what not to eat. Here is a list of what you should eat more of due to their direct or indirect fat loss properties. Keep in mind that everything on this list pertains to the food in its natural form; that is, unprocessed without added fillers and preservatives.\n\n<strong>1. Salmon</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/15110034/Fotolia_65341125_Subscription_XXL.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3324\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/15110034/Fotolia_65341125_Subscription_XXL-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Grilled salmon with a honey glaze on a bed of lambs lettuce\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Salmon is especially beneficial for fat loss. For one, it contains iodine, which is necessary for healthy metabolism function.\n\nSecondly, salmon is loaded with omega-3 fatty acids. Among its many benefits, omega-3s are essential for reducing inflammation, a condition which contributes to metabolic disease and obesity as confirmed in this <a href=\"http://www.jci.org/articles/view/57132\">study</a>.\n\n<strong>2. Lean Beef</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/17170000/Fotolia_60769521_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3358\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/17170000/Fotolia_60769521_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Juicy Fillet Steak with Fresh Herbs\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Red meat has been unfairly demonized for causing all sorts of ailments despite numerous studies, such as this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2885952/\">one</a>, finding little to no correlation between cow meat and common diseases.\n\nIn terms of fat loss, lean beef is a proven food for champions. It is packed with protein. <strong>This macronutrient requires more energy to digest compared to carbs and fat.</strong> This means more calories burned.\n\nIn addition, raising your daily protein consumption by 25% has also been shown to cut cravings by up to 60%.\n\n<strong>3. White Potatoes</strong>\n\nWhite potatoes usually get a bad rep, with most people recommending yams and sweet potatoes instead. White potatoes, though, are more beneficial than most people realize...\n\nFor instance, they are a rich source of potassium, which helps keep blood pressure in check.\n\nHere’s another thing about white potatoes: if you boil them, they form a fiber-like substance known as resistant starch, <strong>which aids in fat loss by producing good bacteria needed for healthy digestion.</strong>\n\n<strong>4. Beans</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/17170000/Fotolia_71025394_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3359\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/17170000/Fotolia_71025394_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x198.jpg\" alt=\"White bean salad on a wooden board.

I recommend sticking to lentils, kidney, and black beans as these tend to have a higher protein and fiber content, both of which have been shown to help you reach satiety.\n\nLike white potatoes, beans also contain a good amount of resistant starch.\n\n<strong>5. Cottage Cheese</strong>\n\nHere’s yet another protein-dense food that will keep your belly nicely satiated. On top of that, cottage cheese, or most dairy products for that matter, is also loaded with calcium.\n\nAside from promoting bone mineral density, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15090625\">studies</a> also show that calcium is a proven fat lost booster.\n<h3>Eat Smart, Lose Fat</h3>\nThe best foods for losing fat are far more extensive than just the choices listed above. Put it this way:<strong> if the food comes from a natural, unprocessed source, then it contains some nutrient that aids in fat loss be it directly or indirectly.</strong>\n\nThe foods listed can be combined for a delicious and nutrient-packed meal or consumed individually as an in-between snack.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>On the subject of fat loss, I recommend supplementing with <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\">Tea Rexx</a>. </strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, it’s a supplement and not food, but it contains ingredients found in some of the world’s best known superfoods for reducing body fat and appetite..</p><p>\"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Calories aren't the only thing that aid in fat loss, food choices can be just as important.

This can be really disheartening if you’re transitioning from a muscle building to a fat loss phase.\n\nLosing even a small portion of muscle that you worked so hard for can be really soul crushing - especially for men. I want to assure you, however, that it is very possible to lose fat without losing muscle.\n<h3>How to Preserve Muscle</h3>\nThe reason fat loss and muscle preservation is so tricky is because <strong>losing fat requires a calorie deficit, while muscle requires more calories to grow or even remain in its current size. </strong>\n\nMost lifters who go on a fat loss regimen ultimately lose fat at the expense of losing a bit of muscle.\n\n<strong>It doesn’t have to be this way</strong>, though, not if you train and diet the way I recommend. Your approach will require razor-precision, and I will explain exactly what needs to be done so you retain your mass as the fat melts off.\n<h3>Maintain Your Strength Training Routine</h3>\nWhen you transition to a fat loss phase, you still need to strength train with the same ferocity as you did when you were in a muscle building phase. Too many people take their foot off the pedal when it comes to resistance training the minute they shift their focus to losing fat.\n\nAs a result, their muscles begin to wane from the less-intense workout.\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether you’re using free weights, kettlebells, or body calisthenics; whatever your strength training routine was, you need to maintain it and go full blast just as you did before. This part of your training doesn’t change just because muscle gaining is no longer at the forefront.\n<h3>Stick With HIIT</h3>\nAnother reason so many people lose muscle is because t<strong>hey do traditional cardio as opposed to high-intensity training like HIIT</strong>. I have spoken many times about the fat loss consequences of aerobic exercises like a 30 minute jog or biking.\n\nHIIT directly targets your fat stores for fuel reserves, whereas moderately-paced cardio partially eats into the protein in your muscles.\n\nIn addition, HIIT also helps maintain muscle mass indirectly by elevating testosterone levels. This was all proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23310924\">study</a>.\n\nAlternatively, you can also do what I like to refer as “slow cardio.” This is basically power walking done at a speed below what would be considered a jogging pace.\n\nWalking is actually very effective for fat loss while preserving muscle. The only problem, though, is that you have to do A LOT of walking for the results to kick in.\n\nBy a lot, I’m talking about roughly one hour four to five times a week. This is why I stick to HIIT since it only takes 15-20 minutes.\n\nNevertheless, slow cardio is an effective alternative if you’re unable to perform HIIT due to an injury.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d6HkzYrFXwU?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Watch What You Eat</h3>\nThe dieting is perhaps the trickiest component of all. Since you’re eating less to create a calorie deficit, you have to really make those calories count.\n\nProtein really has to be your primary macronutrient, consisting of 1 gram per pound of bodyweight at minimum of your daily food intake. Protein contains the essential amino acids necessary for preserving muscle mass.\n\nAs far as carb goes, the amount that you do consume should be from complex sources. While fruit is an exception to this rule, all other sources should be from foods like oatmeal, brown rice, and yams.\n\nSimple and refined sugars should be limited as much as possible when you’re trying to shed fat.\n<h3>Keep the Muscle You Earned</h3>\nGaining lean muscle is no easy journey that requires dedication in and out of the gym. This is why you should continue to work just as hard to maintain it once you begin focusing on fat loss.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>For a complete workout plan that will have you losing fat without losing muscle, I suggest you check out my <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">thesimpleshreddedsolution</a> program.</strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Check out this transformation one of my students was able to make. </strong>.</p><p>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/21110040/11054866_10206336323221268_2706960894975791455_n.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/21110040/11054866_10206336323221268_2706960894975791455_n-300x209.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/21110040/11054866_10206336323221268_2706960894975791455_n.jpg 720w\" alt=\"11054866_10206336323221268_2706960894975791455_n\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>He was able to lose fat and not only maintain muscle, but gain some! </strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>He achieved these results following the tactics and strategies I cover in my <a href=\"http://thesimpleshreddedsolution.com\">thesimpleshreddedsolution</a> program</strong>.</p><p>\"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">When losing weight, your goal should be to lose fat while losing as little muscle as possible, This post will show you how to achieve this!</h3>  \n\n<p>Fat loss is a tricky endeavor because if not done the right way, you can end up sacrificing just as much, if not more, muscle mass.

Here is how you can implement it into your workout routine to lose more fat.</h3>\nLately, a lot of people have asked me about my opinion on yoga and whether it’s an effective training style for fat loss.\n\nHere’s my simple answer: Any workout that burns lots of calories, raises your metabolism, and targets your fat stores is an effective regimen. Yoga actually meets all of those criteria.\n<h3>Yoga Explained</h3>\nThere are a lot of misconceptions about yoga from people who never tried it. Some of the stuff I hear includes:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>It’s for women; real men lift weights</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>It’s just stretching</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>It’s only for people who can bend their body into a pretzel</strong></li>\n</ul>\nIf you never tried it, then it’s a challenge that I would highly recommend you try because it’s a lot more difficult than most people realize.\n\nAfter completing a few sessions, I quickly became hooked and now occasionally incorporate it into my routine when I feel like doing something besides <a href=\"http://www.directhiit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HIIT</a>.\n<h3>Yes, Yoga Flattens Your Belly</h3>\nIf you’re in a fat loss phase, then I strongly recommend yoga. This goes for the guys just as much as for the women. There is evidence that proves there is some serious validity behind regular yoga practice.\n\nIn one <a href=\"http://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-tips/surprising-way-gentle-yoga-can-help-you-lose-serious-weight\">study</a> conducted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1,500 subjects underwent a regular yoga routine at least once a week for four years. At the conclusion of the study, <strong>subjects lost an average of 5lbs</strong>. Now, a 5lb loss over a four year span may seem minuscule, but the study also discovered that subjects within the same age group that did not do yoga gained an average of 13.5lbs over that period. <strong>That’s nearly a 20lbs difference between the yoga and non-yoga group!</strong>\n\nThe man behind the research, Alan Kristal, also discovered that those who do yoga are more likely to practice <a href=\"https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/releases/2009/08/yoga.html\">mindful eating</a>.\n\nBy mindful eating, this meant being aware of their bodily sensations as they ate and stopping the minute they felt full. It is believed that mindful eating is also directly connected to the weight loss experienced by the subjects.\n<h3>Find a Yoga Practice Right for You</h3>\nThere are dozens of yoga variations. Personally, I don’t believe the style you choose matters so much as the work you put into it.\n\nHowever, when it comes to recommendations, I happen to be a fan of acro yoga. As suggested in its name, the style combines elements of yoga and acrobatics and is best performed with a partner.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wptT2k6T-5Q?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nAs you can see from my video, the workout requires a bit of core strength. Having performed isometrics in the past may prove to be a great help to prepare you for the movements required.\n\nIf this workout is too advanced for you, then here is a yoga workout more suitable for novices\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SPZN8z9HsNI?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Be Open to Different Training Modalities</h3>\nI admit that I was a weight lifting purist and scoffed at the idea of yoga just a few years ago. However, as I evolve in my fitness foray, I quickly discovered that yoga as well as other ways of training are just as valid as hitting the weights.\n\nThis is why my posts often include various workout recommendations, such as kettlebell training, isometrics, and cardio boxing.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>This is also why I created <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/bodyweight-blast/\">Bodyweight Blast</a> because body calisthenics is another valid way of training for muscle gains and fat loss.</strong>.</p><p>\nMake no mistake about it, yoga will help you burn massive calories because your body will be working extra hard to maintain certain poses and positions. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEpyHCKcLLs\" target=\"_blank\">deep breathing</a> that goes with it will certainly help as well because the extra oxygen intake has been shown to boost metabolism.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Like shown in this post, Yoga is a great way to burn calories and get rid of unwanted fat... this is why I've included it in my highly anticipated new workout program <a href=\"http://www.directhiit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DIRECT HIIT</a>.</strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Make sure to sign up and be one of the first people to know when it goes live! </strong>.</p><p>\"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Yoga is a great way to burn calories and improve mindfulness.

There is evidence that proves there is some serious validity behind regular yoga practice.</p>\n\n<p>In one <a href=\"http://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-tips/surprising-way-gentle-yoga-can-help-you-lose-serious-weight\">study</a> conducted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1,500 subjects underwent a regular yoga routine at least once a week for four years. At the conclusion of the study, <strong>subjects lost an average of 5lbs</strong>. Now, a 5lb loss over a four year span may seem minuscule, but the study also discovered that subjects within the same age group that did not do yoga gained an average of 13.5lbs over that period. <strong>That’s nearly a 20lbs difference between the yoga and non-yoga group!</strong></p>\n\n<p>The man behind the research, Alan Kristal, also discovered that those who do yoga are more likely to practice <a href=\"https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/releases/2009/08/yoga.html\">mindful eating</a>.</p>\n\n<p>By mindful eating, this meant being aware of their bodily sensations as they ate and stopping the minute they felt full. It is believed that mindful eating is also directly connected to the weight loss experienced by the subjects.  </p>\n\n<h3>Find a Yoga Practice Right for You</h3>  \n\n<p>There are dozens of yoga variations. Personally, I don’t believe the style you choose matters so much as the work you put into it.</p>\n\n<p>However, when it comes to recommendations, I happen to be a fan of acro yoga. As suggested in its name, the style combines elements of yoga and acrobatics and is best performed with a partner.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wptT2k6T-5Q?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<p>As you can see from my video, the workout requires a bit of core strength. Having performed isometrics in the past may prove to be a great help to prepare you for the movements required.</p>\n\n<p>If this workout is too advanced for you, then here is a yoga workout more suitable for novices</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SPZN8z9HsNI?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>  \n\n<h3>Be Open to Different Training Modalities</h3>  \n\n<p>I admit that I was a weight lifting purist and scoffed at the idea of yoga just a few years ago. However, as I evolve in my fitness foray, I quickly discovered that yoga as well as other ways of training are just as valid as hitting the weights.</p>\n\n<p>This is why my posts often include various workout recommendations, such as kettlebell training, isometrics, and cardio boxing. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>This is also why I created <a href=\"https://my.brandoncarter.com/product/bodyweight-blast/\">Bodyweight Blast</a> because body calisthenics is another valid way of training for muscle gains and fat loss.</strong>.</p><p> <br />\nMake no mistake about it, yoga will help you burn massive calories because your body will be working extra hard to maintain certain poses and positions. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEpyHCKcLLs\" target=\"_blank\">deep breathing</a> that goes with it will certainly help as well because the extra oxygen intake has been shown to boost metabolism. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Like shown in this post, Yoga is a great way to burn calories and get rid of unwanted fat... this is why I've included it in my highly anticipated new workout program <a href=\"http://www.directhiit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DIRECT HIIT</a>.</strong>.</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Make sure to sign up and be one of the first people to know when it goes live! </strong>.</p><p>\"</p>","amp":null,"image":"//media.brandoncarter.com/2016/01/IMG_8638.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-12-24 11:00:26","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-12-24 11:00:26","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-12-24 11:00:26","published_by":1},{"id":2275,"uuid":"0ca2c210-0cf8-440f-b103-f311326eb092","title":"Easy Cardio Workout for the Newbie","slug":"easy-cardio-workout-for-the-newbie","markdown":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">If you're new to working out, doing too much can be just as bad as doing nothing at all!

It's boring and less effective than HIIT. Here is how you can turbocharge your metabolism by using Sprinting HIIT.</h3>\nFor those who have been keeping up with my posts, it should be clear by now that I have no love for jogging or other light-paced cardio.\n\n<strong>It’s simply ineffective.</strong>\n\nSure, you’ll burn fat, but sacrifice just as much muscle. This explains why so many marathoners and recreational joggers have that skinny-fat physique.\n\nThere are a number of ways to do cardio; it really doesn’t matter how you do it as long as you go at a high pace that leaves your gas tank totally depleted within a minute or less. This is why sprinting is a great cardio workout that you can incorporate into your HIIT routine.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Sprinting Routine</h3>\nI’m always a big advocate of mixing things up. Sprinting a mile is a great alternative to traditional HIIT.\n\nHere’s a fun sprinting exercise for you: If a track is available, then lace up your shoes and run one mile. You will gun it and sprint as if you were running from a bear on the long portion of the track and walk or jog when you hit the shorter, rounded portion of the track. This part is essentially your rest.\n\nThis workout is a lot more intense than running a full mile at a moderate pace even though you’re covering the same distance. Try it, and you will know what I mean.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NP8W23ToaL8?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nIf a track isn’t available, then you may also do the exercise on the treadmill. Select a speed that will have you sprinting and lower the speed to a walking or jogging pace at certain intervals before moving the speed up again.\n\nEssentially, the 1-mile exercise will look something like this:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">00-.20</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Sprint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">.20-.25</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Walk/jog</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">.25-.45</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Sprint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">.45-.50</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Walk/jog</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">.50-.70</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Sprint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">.70-.75</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Walk/jog</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">.75-1.00</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Sprint</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThe figures on the left correspond to the distance. You can change it up to suit your fitness level.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Other Sprinting Exercises</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31110050/The-Truth-About-Running-and-Testosterone-What-You-Need-to-Know-Before-Getting-on-the-Treadmill-5-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31110050/The-Truth-About-Running-and-Testosterone-What-You-Need-to-Know-Before-Getting-on-the-Treadmill-5-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31110050/The-Truth-About-Running-and-Testosterone-What-You-Need-to-Know-Before-Getting-on-the-Treadmill-5-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31110050/The-Truth-About-Running-and-Testosterone-What-You-Need-to-Know-Before-Getting-on-the-Treadmill-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31110050/The-Truth-About-Running-and-Testosterone-What-You-Need-to-Know-Before-Getting-on-the-Treadmill-5.jpg 6000w\" alt=\"Man ready to run on the track\" />\n\nThere are so many other variations you can incorporate. With the treadmill, instead of running one mile, slow the speed down a bit and raise the incline.

It's boring and less effective than HIIT. Here is how you can turbocharge your metabolism by using Sprinting HIIT.</h3>  \n\n<p>For those who have been keeping up with my posts, it should be clear by now that I have no love for jogging or other light-paced cardio.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It’s simply ineffective.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sure, you’ll burn fat, but sacrifice just as much muscle. This explains why so many marathoners and recreational joggers have that skinny-fat physique.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of ways to do cardio; it really doesn’t matter how you do it as long as you go at a high pace that leaves your gas tank totally depleted within a minute or less. This is why sprinting is a great cardio workout that you can incorporate into your HIIT routine.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Sprinting Routine</h3>  \n\n<p>I’m always a big advocate of mixing things up. Sprinting a mile is a great alternative to traditional HIIT.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a fun sprinting exercise for you: If a track is available, then lace up your shoes and run one mile. You will gun it and sprint as if you were running from a bear on the long portion of the track and walk or jog when you hit the shorter, rounded portion of the track. This part is essentially your rest.</p>\n\n<p>This workout is a lot more intense than running a full mile at a moderate pace even though you’re covering the same distance. Try it, and you will know what I mean.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NP8W23ToaL8?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<p>If a track isn’t available, then you may also do the exercise on the treadmill. Select a speed that will have you sprinting and lower the speed to a walking or jogging pace at certain intervals before moving the speed up again.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the 1-mile exercise will look something like this:  </p>\n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">00-.20</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Sprint</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">.20-.25</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Walk/jog</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">.25-.45</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Sprint</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">.45-.50</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Walk/jog</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">.50-.70</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Sprint</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">.70-.75</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Walk/jog</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">.75-1.00</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Sprint</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<p>The figures on the left correspond to the distance.

Here are 9 common mistakes when choosing a pre workout supplement</h3>\nDo you absolutely need a pre-workout supplement? No. There are dozens of athletes and fitness enthusiasts that maintain a solid physique relying solely on whole foods. No personal trainers worth their salt will tell you that muscle gains or fat loss is futile without supplementation.\n\nWith that being said, however, chugging down a pre-workout drink mix will give you that extra amp to push yourself just a little harder in the gym or on the track.\n\nBe advised, though, that <strong>not all supplements are created equal</strong>.\n\nChoosing a pre-exercise supplement is definitely something you want to be choosy about. With so many supplement options, are you making these mistakes when making your selection?\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #1: Not Looking at the Ingredients</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_84099660_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x559.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_84099660_Subscription_Monthly_XL-150x82.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_84099660_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x164.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_84099660_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x559.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_84099660_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg 4000w\" alt=\"Funny image of young man looking in magnifying glass\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When it comes to supplements, the best single piece of advice is this: stick with basic ingredients. If you’ve ever flipped through a fitness or bodybuilding magazine, then you know they are notorious for displaying supplement ads just about every other page..</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">These new products always supposedly contain “breakthrough” ingredients that the ads claim renders all other ingredients obsolete. When it comes to these alleged “scientific breakthroughs,” take it with a grain of salt..</p><p>\nRemember, the supplement industry is a business; their first and foremost goal is to make a profit. To do that, they need to release new products that are supposedly an improvement over the previous one released.\n\nThis isn’t to say that new products should automatically be dismissed; it just means you should be naturally skeptical.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Stick to the Basics</strong>.</p><p>\nWhen it comes to pre-workout supplements, just stick to the basics and what has been proven to work.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This includes tried and proven ingredients like<strong> <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a>, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">creatine monohydrate</a>, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supercharge-your-workouts-with-beta-alanine/\" target=\"_blank\">beta-alanine</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/feeling-lethargic-fight-your-fatigue-with-l-citrulline-malate/\" target=\"_blank\">L-citruline</a></strong> malate just to list a few..</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The formula in <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> includes all of the above ingredients and has ZERO proprietary blends.</strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ideally, the ingredients list should be fairly brief. If the list is nearly the length of a paragraph, then the rest is usually just useless fillers that either do nothing or at worse dilute the primary ingredients<strong>.</strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Stick to What Has Been Scientifically Proven</strong>.</p><p>\nHere’s a good rule of thumb to follow: if there is no scientific literature that verifies the ingredient’s efficacy as an energy booster, then stay away from it.\n\nBy scientific literature, this means independent studies published under actual scientific journals.\n\nMany supplement ads include scientific studies. However, these are often studies funded by the company. Obviously, the company has a financial incentive for reaching a specific result, so you can’t expect unbiased findings.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #2: Choosing a Product With too Much Sugar</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_79555002_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x577.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_79555002_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x169.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_79555002_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x577.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_79555002_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg 4260w\" alt=\"eker\" />\n\nA lot of energy drinks as well as pre-workout formulas have sugar content levels comparable to soda pop, sometimes even more.\n\nMany energy products provide energy via simple sugar because sugar is cheap, and it certainly does give you immediate energy, though as you probably know, the energy is quickly followed by a crash where you feel lethargic all of a sudden.\n\nOn top of that, sugar also wrecks all sort of havoc on your body. <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/where-science-meets-the-steps/201309/4-ways-sugar-could-be-harming-your-mental-health\">Studies</a> have l<strong>inked it to depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline.</strong>\n\nAccording to the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyEating/Added-Sugars-Add-to-Your-Risk-of-Dying-from-Heart-Disease_UCM_460319_Article.jsp\">American Heart Association</a>, excess sugar also increases your risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\nA pre-workout supplement that contains mostly sugar is not a whole lot better than a can of Coke or Pepsi. In fact, you might as well drink a can of soda pop because it’s cheaper, and you’ll get the same buzz and kick. Soda, after all, also contains a small amount of caffeine.\n\nThe same holds true if the supplement contains other “healthier” sugars, such as cane sugar, evaporated cane juice, agave syrup, or sugar alcohol.\n\nThese are usually touted as being natural, and therefore somehow less harmful. Whether it’s the common table sugar or a natural source, the effects of too much sugar are all the same on the body.\n\nAnother issue is that the extra sugar also translates to additional calories. <strong>These are empty calories with zero nutritional benefits</strong>. These are also calories that you have to especially keep tabs on if you’re on a calorie deficit and trying to lose fat.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #3: Buying the Cheapest Pre-Workout Supplement</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_95756722_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x675.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_95756722_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x99.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_95756722_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x198.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_95756722_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x675.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_95756722_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5000w\" alt=\"Cheap.\" />\n\nIt’s understandable that people want to save money when it comes to supplements. They're sometimes not cheap and if you supplement stack, meaning you take multiple products (e.g. whey protein, <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">fat burners</a>, <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/revolt\" target=\"_blank\">BCAAs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/fighter-fuel?variant=14954915207\" target=\"_blank\">etc</a>), then that’s quite a hefty monthly budget.\n\nHowever, the saying that you often get what you pay for definitely applies to supplements. Once again, supplement companies want to maximize profit while cutting down on overhead cost.\n\nAs a result, each serving may contain very little of the primary ingredients with the rest being useless fillers.\n\nWhile you don’t want to purchase the cheapest pre-workout formula on the market, it may not be necessary to buy the most expensive. When you buy supplements on the pricier end, it is crucial to understand what it is  you're paying for.\n\nIf you are spending money on a pre-workout, you want to make sure that you are buying a product that includes high quality ingredients that are proven to be scientifically effective.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #4: Choosing a Supplement Based on Brand Alone</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_66903197_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_66903197_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_66903197_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_66903197_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_66903197_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5807w\" alt=\"Supplements bottle with supplements\" />\n\nSome supplement brands are extremely well-known. I am sure you have seen your favorite bodybuilder or physique competitor advertising for a big name supplement company.\n\nPopularity, though, does not always equal quality. As was mentioned earlier, the reason name brand supplements cost more is mainly to offset the overhead marketing cost and endorsements.\n\nThe more popular brands also tend to be the ones that release new products that are featured in fitness magazines with a lengthy report that outlines some of the so-called breakthroughs discussed earlier.\n\nThese reports are often accompanied by before and after photos, scientific illustrations, and detailed explanations of the new ingredient that is glamorized as being the next fountain of youth.\n\nUnfortunately, its not uncommon for the studies backing these supplements to be company-funded which can result in them being heavily biased.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This isn’t to paint high name supplement brands in a broad brush and say they’re all shady. It’s just to point out that the ingredients in a supplement are more important than the popularity of a company..</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>This is a big reason I created my supplement line <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bro Labs</a>. I wanted to create supplements that had scientifically proven ingredients and weren't overpriced like many supplement companies. </strong>.</p><p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #5: Using a Pre-Workout Supplement With Ineffective Dosages</h3>\nSome supplements do not contain optimum dosages. When it comes to caffeine, some brands contain as little as 40mg, roughly half the amount contained in an 8-ounce cup of coffee.\n\nWhile this may suffice for some people, it’s hardly enough to really amp you up especially if you’re a big guy. Some people naturally respond to caffeine better than others, <strong>but a good amount per serving is about 150mg to 200mg</strong>.\n\nThe maximum recommended daily amount is 400mg, so this leaves room for a second serving should you need it later in the day.\n\nThe same goes for other ingredients commonly found in pre-workout supplements. <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">Creatine </a>is another typical ingredient. Some contain as little as one or two grams per serving.\n\nThis isn’t big deal if you supplement separately with a creatine monohydrate product, but <strong>studies suggest you need at a minimum 3 grams per day.</strong>\n\nSupplements with too small of a dosage may require you to take 1.5 or 2 servings. This means using up the product more quickly and having to buy more.\n\nTaking more than a single serving in one sitting also potentially means overdosing on other ingredients. A pre-workout supplement may only have 40mg of caffeine but 100% of your daily serving of, say, retinol acid (vitamin A).\n\nIf you take 1.5 or 2 servings, then you are sure to get way more vitamin A then your body needs. Vitamin A overdose has been linked to liver damage and bone pain.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #6: Being Swayed by a Unique Propriety Blend</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_80363545_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_80363545_Subscription_Monthly_XL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_80363545_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_80363545_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_80363545_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg 4350w\" alt=\"one hundred dollars banknote as a bait in mousetrap concept\" />\n\nWhat does it mean when a product contains a propriety blend? They’re quite common and every brand seems to have their own unique blend that seemingly distinguishes it from the competitors.\n\nA propriety blend just basically means that <strong>the supplement contains a blend of ingredients that are listed under a single name</strong>.\n\nThe propriety blend usually has some cool sounding name along with the patented symbol indicating that the blend is protected by a trademark.\n\nHere’s the thing: <strong>propriety blends are mostly a gimmick</strong>. This isn’t to say they’re all worthless; it’s to say that they’re just a way for the company to advertise its latest product as being revolutionary due to having a propriety blend containing secretly guarded ingredients.\n\nEven when the ingredients are listed, the exact amount of each of those ingredients is often not listed. Instead, the label lists the sum total amount of all the ingredients combined.\n\nWhen it comes to pre-workout drinks, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> is often among the ingredients, which means the amount is not listed. You always want to know how much caffeine you’re getting because you don’t want to risk overdosing if you also consume caffeine from other sources.\n\nAnother common occurrence is to list an ingredient, but not provide the clinically effective dosage. If a supplement lists an ingredient within a proprietary blend, there is no way of knowing if you are getting the right amount of that ingredient to see results.\n\nAny supplement company worth its salt should be completely transparent and fully disclose everything that goes into its product along with its exact dosage of every ingredient. <strong>You should always know what you are getting with each serving</strong>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #7: Using a Pre-Workout Supplement Without Compatible Ingredients</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You can’t simply mishmash ingredients together simply because they have all been proven to have a positive effect on the body. Some ingredients are better absorbed by the body when combined with other ingredients..</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It was recently discovered, for example, that a substance found in grapefruit, known as <a href=\"http://www.phytochemicals.info/phytochemicals/naringin.php\">narangin</a>, actually keeps caffeine in the body for longer periods, thus prolonging its effects..</p><p>\nOne ingredient in <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a>, called <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/the-amazing-wonders-of-black-pepper-fruit-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">black pepper extract</a>, has been shown to increase the absorption of certain nutrients and ingredients.\n\nThere are also ingredients that should not be combined as they may compete for absorption with one cancelling out the other.\n\nCaffeine has been shown to inhibit the absorption of iron, so combining it with caffeine is clearly not a smart blend. Many supplement makers incorporate blends that do not take such factors into consideration.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #8: Using a Pre-Workout Supplement With Unnatural or Synthetic Ingredients</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_53606075_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_53606075_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_53606075_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_53606075_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_53606075_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5184w\" alt=\"Deadly poison in bottles on black background\" />\n\nNot all ingredients are created equal. Take vitamin C, for example; the vitamin in supplement form comes in a synthetic variety known as ascorbic acid.\n\nWhile ascorbic acid is labelled as vitamin C, it is actually missing 80% of vitamin C’s molecular structure.\n\nThe same holds true for many other ingredients, especially those that are found in pre-workout supplements.\n\nOnce again, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> is placed at the forefront of the discussion because the stimulant is available in a variety of forms.\n\nThere is natural caffeine, such as that found in coffee, and there is synthetic caffeine made via chemical or biochemical synthesis. Synthetic caffeine is the variety found in your typical energy drink or shot (i.e. Red Bull, 5 Hour Energy, Monster, etc.).\n\nWhile synthetic caffeine is known to produce a quicker spike in energy, it also results in a greater crash and side effects, such as jitteriness, sleeplessness, nervousness, and all the other symptoms that natural caffeine has been vilified for.\n\nNatural caffeine, such as those derived from <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/rejuvenate-body-proven-power-green-tea-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">green tea</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/fighter-fuel/\" target=\"_blank\">black coffee beans</a>, and yerba mate, are far better sources that provides a sustained release of energy.\n\n<strong>Liquid Caffeine vs Caffeine Anhydrous</strong>\n\nHere’s something else to digest(<em>no pun intended</em>): even natural caffeine comes in different forms. <strong>There’s natural caffeine and there’s caffeine anhydrous</strong>. The latter is basically the caffeine dehydrated and reduced to powder form.\n\nCaffeine anhydrous is mainly the type found in products like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>.\n\nAccording to a <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/474530-anhydrous-caffeine-vs-caffeine/\">study</a> conducted by the International Society of Sports Nutrition, anhydrous caffeine is <strong>more effective in low to moderate doses compared to coffee</strong> for subjects performing time-trial athletic performances and exhaustive exercises.\n\nWith this in mind, when a pre-workout supplement contains caffeine as a primary ingredient, there are two things you should be looking for:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Is it natural or synthetic caffeine?</strong> and</li>\n \t<li><strong>Is the caffeine in liquid or caffeine anhydrous form?</strong></li>\n</ol>\nWith the second point, if the product comes as powder or pill, then it’s obviously caffeine anhydrous.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #9: Buying a Supplement Solely Based on User Reviews</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_49695838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x728.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_49695838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x213.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_49695838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x728.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_49695838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5266w\" alt=\"Muscular Male holding supplements\" />\n\nWhat’s wrong with user reviews?

Could it be that the product really is that good?\n\nSure, that’s possible, but more likely a bulk of the reviews came from people affiliated in one way or another with the product.\n\n<strong>The same applies to workout supplements</strong>. You have to be very careful when reading the reviews.

In fact, you might as well drink a can of soda pop because it’s cheaper, and you’ll get the same buzz and kick. Soda, after all, also contains a small amount of caffeine.</p>\n\n<p>The same holds true if the supplement contains other “healthier” sugars, such as cane sugar, evaporated cane juice, agave syrup, or sugar alcohol.</p>\n\n<p>These are usually touted as being natural, and therefore somehow less harmful. Whether it’s the common table sugar or a natural source, the effects of too much sugar are all the same on the body.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue is that the extra sugar also translates to additional calories. <strong>These are empty calories with zero nutritional benefits</strong>.

I am sure you have seen your favorite bodybuilder or physique competitor advertising for a big name supplement company.</p>\n\n<p>Popularity, though, does not always equal quality. As was mentioned earlier, the reason name brand supplements cost more is mainly to offset the overhead marketing cost and endorsements.</p>\n\n<p>The more popular brands also tend to be the ones that release new products that are featured in fitness magazines with a lengthy report that outlines some of the so-called breakthroughs discussed earlier.</p>\n\n<p>These reports are often accompanied by before and after photos, scientific illustrations, and detailed explanations of the new ingredient that is glamorized as being the next fountain of youth.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, its not uncommon for the studies backing these supplements to be company-funded which can result in them being heavily biased. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This isn’t to paint high name supplement brands in a broad brush and say they’re all shady. It’s just to point out that the ingredients in a supplement are more important than the popularity of a company..</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>This is a big reason I created my supplement line <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bro Labs</a>. I wanted to create supplements that had scientifically proven ingredients and weren't overpriced like many supplement companies. </strong>.</p><p></p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #5: Using a Pre-Workout Supplement With Ineffective Dosages</h3>  \n\n<p>Some supplements do not contain optimum dosages. When it comes to caffeine, some brands contain as little as 40mg, roughly half the amount contained in an 8-ounce cup of coffee.</p>\n\n<p>While this may suffice for some people, it’s hardly enough to really amp you up especially if you’re a big guy. Some people naturally respond to caffeine better than others, <strong>but a good amount per serving is about 150mg to 200mg</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The maximum recommended daily amount is 400mg, so this leaves room for a second serving should you need it later in the day.</p>\n\n<p>The same goes for other ingredients commonly found in pre-workout supplements. <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">Creatine </a>is another typical ingredient. Some contain as little as one or two grams per serving.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t big deal if you supplement separately with a creatine monohydrate product, but <strong>studies suggest you need at a minimum 3 grams per day.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Supplements with too small of a dosage may require you to take 1.5 or 2 servings. This means using up the product more quickly and having to buy more.</p>\n\n<p>Taking more than a single serving in one sitting also potentially means overdosing on other ingredients. A pre-workout supplement may only have 40mg of caffeine but 100% of your daily serving of, say, retinol acid (vitamin A).</p>\n\n<p>If you take 1.5 or 2 servings, then you are sure to get way more vitamin A then your body needs. Vitamin A overdose has been linked to liver damage and bone pain.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #6: Being Swayed by a Unique Propriety Blend</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_80363545_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_80363545_Subscription_Monthly_XL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_80363545_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_80363545_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_80363545_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg 4350w\" alt=\"one hundred dollars banknote as a bait in mousetrap concept\" /></p>\n\n<p>What does it mean when a product contains a propriety blend?

This isn’t to say they’re all worthless; it’s to say that they’re just a way for the company to advertise its latest product as being revolutionary due to having a propriety blend containing secretly guarded ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>Even when the ingredients are listed, the exact amount of each of those ingredients is often not listed. Instead, the label lists the sum total amount of all the ingredients combined.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to pre-workout drinks, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> is often among the ingredients, which means the amount is not listed.

If a supplement lists an ingredient within a proprietary blend, there is no way of knowing if you are getting the right amount of that ingredient to see results.</p>\n\n<p>Any supplement company worth its salt should be completely transparent and fully disclose everything that goes into its product along with its exact dosage of every ingredient. <strong>You should always know what you are getting with each serving</strong>  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #7: Using a Pre-Workout Supplement Without Compatible Ingredients</h3>  \n\n<p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">You can’t simply mishmash ingredients together simply because they have all been proven to have a positive effect on the body. Some ingredients are better absorbed by the body when combined with other ingredients..</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It was recently discovered, for example, that a substance found in grapefruit, known as <a href=\"http://www.phytochemicals.info/phytochemicals/naringin.php\">narangin</a>, actually keeps caffeine in the body for longer periods, thus prolonging its effects..</p><p> <br />\nOne ingredient in <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a>, called <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/the-amazing-wonders-of-black-pepper-fruit-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">black pepper extract</a>, has been shown to increase the absorption of certain nutrients and ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>There are also ingredients that should not be combined as they may compete for absorption with one cancelling out the other.</p>\n\n<p>Caffeine has been shown to inhibit the absorption of iron, so combining it with caffeine is clearly not a smart blend. Many supplement makers incorporate blends that do not take such factors into consideration.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #8: Using a Pre-Workout Supplement With Unnatural or Synthetic Ingredients</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_53606075_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_53606075_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_53606075_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_53606075_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_53606075_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5184w\" alt=\"Deadly poison in bottles on black background\" /></p>\n\n<p>Not all ingredients are created equal. Take vitamin C, for example; the vitamin in supplement form comes in a synthetic variety known as ascorbic acid.</p>\n\n<p>While ascorbic acid is labelled as vitamin C, it is actually missing 80% of vitamin C’s molecular structure.</p>\n\n<p>The same holds true for many other ingredients, especially those that are found in pre-workout supplements.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> is placed at the forefront of the discussion because the stimulant is available in a variety of forms.</p>\n\n<p>There is natural caffeine, such as that found in coffee, and there is synthetic caffeine made via chemical or biochemical synthesis. Synthetic caffeine is the variety found in your typical energy drink or shot (i.e. Red Bull, 5 Hour Energy, Monster, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>While synthetic caffeine is known to produce a quicker spike in energy, it also results in a greater crash and side effects, such as jitteriness, sleeplessness, nervousness, and all the other symptoms that natural caffeine has been vilified for.</p>\n\n<p>Natural caffeine, such as those derived from <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/rejuvenate-body-proven-power-green-tea-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">green tea</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/fighter-fuel/\" target=\"_blank\">black coffee beans</a>, and yerba mate, are far better sources that provides a sustained release of energy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Liquid Caffeine vs Caffeine Anhydrous</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here’s something else to digest(<em>no pun intended</em>): even natural caffeine comes in different forms. <strong>There’s natural caffeine and there’s caffeine anhydrous</strong>. The latter is basically the caffeine dehydrated and reduced to powder form.</p>\n\n<p>Caffeine anhydrous is mainly the type found in products like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>.</p>\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/474530-anhydrous-caffeine-vs-caffeine/\">study</a> conducted by the International Society of Sports Nutrition, anhydrous caffeine is <strong>more effective in low to moderate doses compared to coffee</strong> for subjects performing time-trial athletic performances and exhaustive exercises.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, when a pre-workout supplement contains caffeine as a primary ingredient, there are two things you should be looking for:  </p>\n\n<ol>  \n     <li><strong>Is it natural or synthetic caffeine?</strong> and</li>\n     <li><strong>Is the caffeine in liquid or caffeine anhydrous form?</strong></li>\n</ol>  \n\n<p>With the second point, if the product comes as powder or pill, then it’s obviously caffeine anhydrous.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #9: Buying a Supplement Solely Based on User Reviews</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_49695838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x728.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_49695838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x213.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_49695838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x728.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01110018/Fotolia_49695838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5266w\" alt=\"Muscular Male holding supplements\" /></p>\n\n<p>What’s wrong with user reviews?

Obviously, these are going to be biased.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, the reviews are even written by freelance writers who never even tried the product and basically write a fake review based on what other reviewers have written.</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever looked up a product on Amazon and noticed that it has an enormous amount of perfect five-star ratings and very few one and two-star reviews? Could it be that the product really is that good?</p>\n\n<p>Sure, that’s possible, but more likely a bulk of the reviews came from people affiliated in one way or another with the product.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The same applies to workout supplements</strong>. You have to be very careful when reading the reviews. Phony reviewers are even becoming smarter.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of saying nothing but good about the product, reviewers will paint the product in a mostly positive light but also list a few minor and overlookable negatives so as not to come off as an obviously biased review.</p>\n\n<p>No matter how good a product actually is, it will have a few people who either expected the product to be a <em>magic pill</em> or for one reason or another just didn’t feel its effects.</p>\n\n<p>Even with a product like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a>, the reviews may not be perfect, but there is a comfort in knowing that the reviews came from real people who gave it an honest try.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Choose Wisely</h3>  \n\n<p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some pre-workout <a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/09133948/Rebellion-3-Pack.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3268\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/09133948/Rebellion-3-Pack-300x248.png\" alt=\"Rebellion-3-Pack\" width=\"300\" height=\"248\" /></a>supplements give you a bolt of energy to help push you through a rigorous workout.

Here are 10 benefits of using a pre-workout supplement.</h3>\nMuscle gains and fat loss are all about what you put in the gym. That is, <strong>results are directly hinged upon how hard you work in the weight room</strong>.\n\nIf you push yourself to the very brink of your physical limit, then you can bet that your muscles are going to grow and the fat is going to melt off.\n\nHowever, digging deep and training to the point of absolute failure cannot always be accomplished on willpower alone. Well, actually, it can, but more often than we would like to admit, our bodies screaming in pain makes us quit before we reached our physical limit.\n\nThis is why there are pre-workout formulas. Not only do they fire you up, but they ignite something inside you that morph you into a mutant on a mission.\n\nThe benefits of a pre-workout supplement are numerous. There’s also plenty of scientific evidence to back them up, so no need to just take these claims at face value.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #1: It Wakes You Up</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/27120444/IMG_5097-e1451235965316.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3444px) 100vw, 3444px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/27120444/IMG_5097-e1451235965316-269x300.jpg 269w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/27120444/IMG_5097-e1451235965316-919x1024.jpg 919w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/27120444/IMG_5097-e1451235965316.jpg 3444w\" alt=\"IMG_5097\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The primary benefit of a pre-workout supplement is the most obvious: it gives you a few slaps in the face to energize you when you’re not in the mood for the gym..</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you work out routinely, then you’ve experienced those moments more often than you would like. No one is immune from those days when they would so rather plop on the couch than get in their strength training or cardio session..</p><p>\nA pre-workout supplement acts as a stimulant. Most brands utilize <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a>, <strong>which is renowned for its multiple benefits besides acting as a powerful pick-me-upper</strong>.

Caffeine works its magic by binding into the adenosine receptors without activating them. All you need to know about adenosine receptors is that they nudge your body towards sleepiness and fatigue.\n\nCaffeine is a widely popular stimulant, but it’s not the only substance known for providing a sustained energy surge.\n\nArginine is also <strong>known to stimulate the body due to the heightened blood and oxygen flow it creates</strong>.\n\nWhile <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> doesn’t contain arginine, it does contain a hefty serving of <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/feeling-lethargic-fight-your-fatigue-with-l-citrulline-malate/\" target=\"_blank\">L-citrulline malate</a>. Aside from causing an insane muscle pump, which you will read about later, <strong>L-citrulline malate induces arginine production.</strong>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #2: It Increases Athletic Performance</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/27121558/Fotolia_81545782_L.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3655px) 100vw, 3655px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/27121558/Fotolia_81545782_L-300x161.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/27121558/Fotolia_81545782_L-1024x551.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/27121558/Fotolia_81545782_L.jpg 3655w\" alt=\"Bodybuilder\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Aside from waking you up, pre-workout supplements also <strong>enhance physical performance in every type of athletic activity from endurance sports to strength training</strong>.

Creatine helps the body by producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is produced by the skeletal muscles for providing energy during strenuous activity..</p><p>\nAnother commonly known ingredient is <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supercharge-your-workouts-with-beta-alanine/\" target=\"_blank\">beta-alanine</a>.  This amino acid has been shown to <strong>increase muscle carnosine concentrations</strong>. Carnosine is a peptide that acts as an antioxidant and offsets muscle fatigue caused by the buildup of hydrogen ions produced during high intensity training.\n\nIf you are training to put on lean muscle mass or to lose body fat, then it is absolutely pivotal that you train to your maximum potential; anything less than your very best efforts results in subpar gains.\n\nFor muscle gains you have to lift to absolute failure for muscle tissue to adapt and grow. Likewise, to lose fat, you have to perform short intervals of high intensity cardio to exhaust your glycogen stores and turn to body fat as an emergency reserve.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #3: It Boosts Mental Function</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_98421615_L.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2356px) 100vw, 2356px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_98421615_L-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_98421615_L-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_98421615_L-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_98421615_L.jpg 2356w\" alt=\"Businessman holding image of human brain in palm\" />\n\nPre-workout supplements also act as food for the brain. This is mainly due to the <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine content</a>, which has been shown to have nootropic-like effects. While it may be a stretch to suggest that caffeine intake will make you into the next Einstein, studies do suggest that it keeps those ever irritating brain fogs at bay.\n\nAccording to a <a href=\"http://www.foodinsight.org/articles/fact-sheet-caffeine-and-performance\">study</a> conducted at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research, consuming approximately 300mg of caffeine a day has been linked to a slower cognitive decline in older women.\n\nFurthermore, other <a href=\"http://hub.jhu.edu/2014/01/12/caffeine-enhances-memory\">studies</a> have linked caffeine to long-term memory retention. Subjects that consumed caffeine were able to better remember a series of images shown from the day prior as well as distinguish between new images that were similar but not identical to the ones shown the previous day.\n\nThis explains why college students often have a coffee pitcher by their study table when cramming their minds with textbook information in preparation for an exam. Yes, the caffeine keeps them awake and alert, but it also improves their ability to retain information as well as absorb new ones.\n\n<strong>Even <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">creatine monohydrate</a> has been shown to improve memory.</strong>\n\nThis is somewhat of a surprise given that the molecule is thought to be solely associated with ATP production and increasing energy output. Well, the science says it all in one <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201202/your-brain-creatine\">study</a> that demonstrates the positive effects of creatine on memory.\n\nOne ingredient in <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> that’s found in few other supplements is <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/the-amazing-wonders-of-black-pepper-fruit-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">black pepper extract</a>. So how does this substance improve cognitive function?\n\nWithin black pepper lies an alkaloid known as piperine. While scientists still aren’t exactly sure how it works, piperine <strong>appears to have some influence on the brain’s chemical pathway that reduces radical-related cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer’s.</strong>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"> Benefit #4: Pre-Workout Supplements Increase Muscle Pump</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8745-e1451242396228.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3456px) 100vw, 3456px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8745-e1451242396228-245x300.jpg 245w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8745-e1451242396228-835x1024.jpg 835w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8745-e1451242396228.jpg 3456w\" alt=\"IMG_8745\" />\n\nIf you do any form of strength training, then you are no stranger to the pump sensation where the muscle you worked feels absolutely jacked. Flexing a pumped muscle is certainly an ego booster. Body builders have an absolute love affair with the muscle pump.\n\nThe muscle pump feeling is a result of the muscle becoming engorged with blood. This actually enhances protein synthesis, which in turn promotes muscle repair and growth. It also decreases muscle breakdown when the muscles are overworked.\n\nThe muscle pump is especially believed to have an effect on fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are stimulated during high volume training, such as lifting extremely heavy under low repetitions, or performing short bouts of explosive movement like sprinting or shooting for a takedown in wrestling.\n\nNitric Oxide (NO) supplements are very popular nowadays as a pre-workout formula due to the insane pumps they are known for delivering. Most pre-workout supplements also contain ingredients known for creating a pump. <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> contains <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/feeling-lethargic-fight-your-fatigue-with-l-citrulline-malate/\" target=\"_blank\">L-citrulline malate</a>, a non-essential amino acid found in apples and melons.\n\nArginine is typically the primary ingredient in most NO products due to its ability to increase oxygen delivery to overworked muscles. Well, L-citrulline malate <strong>has been shown to increase plasma arginine levels more than supplementing with arginine directly.</strong>\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23075551\">study</a> verifies the effects of L-citrulline malate on NO production.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #5: It Helps You Lose Weight</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_54808989_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4928px) 100vw, 4928px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_54808989_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x199.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_54808989_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x678.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_54808989_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 4928w\" alt=\"Man in dieting concept with oversized jeans\" />\n\nPre-workout supplements help you lose weight indirectly by allowing you to work harder in the gym, thus burning more calories. However, many ingredients in a typical pre-workout formula are also known for aiding in weight loss.\n\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">Caffeine has already been established as being more than just a stimulant.</a> Aside from waking you up and improving brain function, <strong>caffeine is also a proven fat loss aid</strong>. This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16076989\">study</a> shows that high caffeine intake raises body thermogenesis and fat oxidation.\n\nAside from boosting metabolism, caffeine also <strong>helps you lose weight by keeping hunger at bay</strong>. Like most stimulants, caffeine is an anorectic agent known for delaying the onset of hunger.\n\nIt’s so effective at blunting hunger, in fact, that the legendary Gallae tribesmen of Ethiopia were known to carry provisions of crushed coffee beans mixed with fat to prevent hunger during lengthy military expeditions.\n\nThis makes caffeine a very helpful agent if you’re on a calorie deficit to lose weight. Consuming coffee just before a meal may actually help make you feel full faster, thus helping you consume less without feeling like you’re being deprived.\n\nIt’s also useful when you’re intermittently fasting. Most caffeine supplements and even pure black coffee minus the sugar and cream contain zero calories.\n\nIf you’re also taking a pre-workout supplement or other caffeinated beverages, Try not to consume more than 400mg/day.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #6: It Speeds Up Muscle Recovery</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_81397101_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5227px) 100vw, 5227px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_81397101_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x93.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_81397101_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x186.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_81397101_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x634.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_81397101_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5227w\" alt=\"handsome young man in shorts, doing exercises for biceps, on a dark background in the studio\" />\n\nIf you strength train to absolute failure, then your muscles are going to be taking a serious beating. Some of the muscle tissue will be damaged, which your cells will have to repair and build back even stronger.\n\nIf you return to the gym before the recovery process is complete, then you may risk overtraining and muscle catabolism.\n\nIt’s typically post-workout supplements that are known for aiding in muscle recovery. However, pre-workout products contain just the right ingredients as well.\n\n<strong>Caffeine actually helps with muscle recovery by increasing glucose and insulin levels after workout.</strong>\n\nThis was proven in a study by the <a href=\"http://www.the-aps.org/mm/hp/audiences/public-press/archive/08/24.html\">American Physiological Society</a> where it was shown that a carbohydrate drink with caffeine improved glucose levels 66% more than a carbohydrate-only drink.\n\nOn top of quicker recovery, caffeine also alleviates muscle soreness in the hours and days following a rigorous workout. If you have ever done strenuous weight training especially following a long layoff, then you should be familiar with sore muscles.\n\nIt’s no fun and your body feels as if it has just been shot out of a cannon. Well, this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24164961\">study</a> is evidence that sipping caffeine helps reduce the feeling of those achy muscles.\n\nIt’s not just caffeine that facilitates recovery; <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/feeling-lethargic-fight-your-fatigue-with-l-citrulline-malate/\" target=\"_blank\">creatine monohydrate</a> has also been shown to have similar effects on sore muscles.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/06/16/creatine-helps-restore-damaged-muscles.html\">Studies</a> show that supplementing with creatine <strong>helps subjects regain their strength faster following a high volume strength training session.</strong>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #7: It’s Good for Your Mood and Well-Being</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_0902.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_0902-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_0902-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_0902-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_0902.jpg 5184w\" alt=\"IMG_0902\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your emotional well-being is just as important as your physical health.

However, you cannot overlook the importance of sound mental well-being.\n\nStress, after all, is linked to excess cortisol production, and too much production of the cortisol hormone has been linked to fat gain and muscle atrophy.\n\nIt has also been linked to increased estrogen (AKA the women hormone) in men.

Americans are more susceptible to preventable disease like pulmonary cancer and stroke due to a western diet. Caffeine, though, may help offset the risk.\n\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">Caffeine</a> has been linked to decreased risk of all too common maladies like obesity and type II diabetes. In fact, in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24764514\">laboratory studies</a>, caffeine has been shown to increase the life span of mice by up to 40%.\n\nDoes this mean our daily morning cup of Joe will add 20 to 30 years of life for people? That’s obviously wishful thinking, but there is certainly something potent about caffeine that warrants further studies.\n\nOn the subject of health, caffeine may also act as a natural wrinkle reducer. For one, caffeine has already been shown to fight off <a href=\"http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/72/13/3282.abstract?sid=5da6c99b-bebe-4bd5-8bfe-19495340589d\">skin cancer</a>, but it just might also keep you looking younger by keeping your skin smooth and supple.\n\nCaffeine actually dehydrates skin and fat cells, thus reducing their water-retaining abilities; the result is less cellulite in common problem areas.\n\nResults are also noticeable in the face as cell dehydration causes bags under the eyes to “de-puff,” making them less apparent.\n\nMentioned earlier was the ingredient <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/the-amazing-wonders-of-black-pepper-fruit-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">black pepper extract</a>. This compound is believed to <strong>promote skin health</strong>. One way it helps is by stimulating the skin to produce pigment.\n\nUnhealthy skin cells are unable to produce ample pigment, and the result is a condition known as vitiligo, a skin disease where the affected skin takes on a whitish hue.\n\nOn top of that, piperine may also reduce the risk of skin cancer caused by ultraviolet radiation exposure.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #10: It Increases Libido</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8653.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8653-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8653-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8653-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8653.jpg 5184w\" alt=\"IMG_8653\" />\n\nYes, you heard that right, pre-workout supplements turn you into a sex monster, no joke! This was verified in a <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-beauty/article/1805330/cup-coffee-or-three-better-sexual-performance\">University of Texas study</a> where it was shown that caffeine consumption reduces the odds of erectile dysfunction in men by up to 42%.\n\nIt’s not just the caffeine. <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">Creatine</a> has also been shown to increase testosterone, and testosterone is linked to higher sperm count.\n\nAlso remember that pre-workout supplements enhance physical performance. Being able to push yourself to the limit in the gym, especially when it comes to heavy compound lifts, is sure as heck going to send your body into a testosterone overdrive. That means even more ample sperm production.\n\nMany men, in fact, have reported increased erections when transitioning from a sedentary to a physically active lifestyle.\n\nWhat about women? Don’t worry; they’re not exactly left out of the equation. A <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/news/20060101/caffeine-sex-potion-for-females\">lab mice study</a> showed that female rats were more quickly to return to their male partner for a second round of intercourse when given a dose of caffeine.\n\nOf course, this study was done on rodents, so it’s not exactly bulletproof evidence that the results translate to human subjects. Nevertheless, it’s quite intriguing and certainly warrants further studies.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"> One Final Note</h3>\nAs you can see, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine is a huge component in a lot of these benefits listed</a>. With that in mind, though, it must be pointed out that caffeine is not some kind of wonder drug, and consuming more does not equate to even more profound benefits. It must be reiterated that the daily recommended dose is 400mg.\n\nDon’t be a bonehead and think that exceeding that amount will equal twice the energy, twice the memory improvement, and so on. Caffeine overdose has been linked to the jitters, anxiety, nausea, rapid heartbeat, insomnia, and dizziness. Too much of it could even prove to be fatal.\n\nAs long as you exercise the most important muscle (your brain), common sense will tell when you had enough cup of Joe for the day.

This is mainly due to the <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine content</a>, which has been shown to have nootropic-like effects. While it may be a stretch to suggest that caffeine intake will make you into the next Einstein, studies do suggest that it keeps those ever irritating brain fogs at bay.</p>\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.foodinsight.org/articles/fact-sheet-caffeine-and-performance\">study</a> conducted at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research, consuming approximately 300mg of caffeine a day has been linked to a slower cognitive decline in older women.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, other <a href=\"http://hub.jhu.edu/2014/01/12/caffeine-enhances-memory\">studies</a> have linked caffeine to long-term memory retention. Subjects that consumed caffeine were able to better remember a series of images shown from the day prior as well as distinguish between new images that were similar but not identical to the ones shown the previous day.</p>\n\n<p>This explains why college students often have a coffee pitcher by their study table when cramming their minds with textbook information in preparation for an exam. Yes, the caffeine keeps them awake and alert, but it also improves their ability to retain information as well as absorb new ones.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Even <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">creatine monohydrate</a> has been shown to improve memory.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is somewhat of a surprise given that the molecule is thought to be solely associated with ATP production and increasing energy output. Well, the science says it all in one <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201202/your-brain-creatine\">study</a> that demonstrates the positive effects of creatine on memory.</p>\n\n<p>One ingredient in <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> that’s found in few other supplements is <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/the-amazing-wonders-of-black-pepper-fruit-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">black pepper extract</a>. So how does this substance improve cognitive function?</p>\n\n<p>Within black pepper lies an alkaloid known as piperine. While scientists still aren’t exactly sure how it works, piperine <strong>appears to have some influence on the brain’s chemical pathway that reduces radical-related cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer’s.</strong>  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"> Benefit #4: Pre-Workout Supplements Increase Muscle Pump</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8745-e1451242396228.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3456px) 100vw, 3456px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8745-e1451242396228-245x300.jpg 245w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8745-e1451242396228-835x1024.jpg 835w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8745-e1451242396228.jpg 3456w\" alt=\"IMG_8745\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you do any form of strength training, then you are no stranger to the pump sensation where the muscle you worked feels absolutely jacked. Flexing a pumped muscle is certainly an ego booster. Body builders have an absolute love affair with the muscle pump.</p>\n\n<p>The muscle pump feeling is a result of the muscle becoming engorged with blood. This actually enhances protein synthesis, which in turn promotes muscle repair and growth. It also decreases muscle breakdown when the muscles are overworked.</p>\n\n<p>The muscle pump is especially believed to have an effect on fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are stimulated during high volume training, such as lifting extremely heavy under low repetitions, or performing short bouts of explosive movement like sprinting or shooting for a takedown in wrestling.</p>\n\n<p>Nitric Oxide (NO) supplements are very popular nowadays as a pre-workout formula due to the insane pumps they are known for delivering. Most pre-workout supplements also contain ingredients known for creating a pump. <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> contains <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/feeling-lethargic-fight-your-fatigue-with-l-citrulline-malate/\" target=\"_blank\">L-citrulline malate</a>, a non-essential amino acid found in apples and melons.</p>\n\n<p>Arginine is typically the primary ingredient in most NO products due to its ability to increase oxygen delivery to overworked muscles. Well, L-citrulline malate <strong>has been shown to increase plasma arginine levels more than supplementing with arginine directly.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23075551\">study</a> verifies the effects of L-citrulline malate on NO production.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #5: It Helps You Lose Weight</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_54808989_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4928px) 100vw, 4928px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_54808989_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x199.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_54808989_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x678.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_54808989_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 4928w\" alt=\"Man in dieting concept with oversized jeans\" /></p>\n\n<p>Pre-workout supplements help you lose weight indirectly by allowing you to work harder in the gym, thus burning more calories.

This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16076989\">study</a> shows that high caffeine intake raises body thermogenesis and fat oxidation.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from boosting metabolism, caffeine also <strong>helps you lose weight by keeping hunger at bay</strong>. Like most stimulants, caffeine is an anorectic agent known for delaying the onset of hunger.</p>\n\n<p>It’s so effective at blunting hunger, in fact, that the legendary Gallae tribesmen of Ethiopia were known to carry provisions of crushed coffee beans mixed with fat to prevent hunger during lengthy military expeditions.</p>\n\n<p>This makes caffeine a very helpful agent if you’re on a calorie deficit to lose weight. Consuming coffee just before a meal may actually help make you feel full faster, thus helping you consume less without feeling like you’re being deprived.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also useful when you’re intermittently fasting.

One way it helps is by stimulating the skin to produce pigment.</p>\n\n<p>Unhealthy skin cells are unable to produce ample pigment, and the result is a condition known as vitiligo, a skin disease where the affected skin takes on a whitish hue.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, piperine may also reduce the risk of skin cancer caused by ultraviolet radiation exposure.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #10: It Increases Libido</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8653.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8653-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8653-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8653-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/IMG_8653.jpg 5184w\" alt=\"IMG_8653\" /></p>\n\n<p>Yes, you heard that right, pre-workout supplements turn you into a sex monster, no joke! This was verified in a <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-beauty/article/1805330/cup-coffee-or-three-better-sexual-performance\">University of Texas study</a> where it was shown that caffeine consumption reduces the odds of erectile dysfunction in men by up to 42%.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not just the caffeine. <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">Creatine</a> has also been shown to increase testosterone, and testosterone is linked to higher sperm count.</p>\n\n<p>Also remember that pre-workout supplements enhance physical performance. Being able to push yourself to the limit in the gym, especially when it comes to heavy compound lifts, is sure as heck going to send your body into a testosterone overdrive. That means even more ample sperm production.</p>\n\n<p>Many men, in fact, have reported increased erections when transitioning from a sedentary to a physically active lifestyle.</p>\n\n<p>What about women? Don’t worry; they’re not exactly left out of the equation. A <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/news/20060101/caffeine-sex-potion-for-females\">lab mice study</a> showed that female rats were more quickly to return to their male partner for a second round of intercourse when given a dose of caffeine.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this study was done on rodents, so it’s not exactly bulletproof evidence that the results translate to human subjects. Nevertheless, it’s quite intriguing and certainly warrants further studies.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"> One Final Note</h3>  \n\n<p>As you can see, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine is a huge component in a lot of these benefits listed</a>. With that in mind, though, it must be pointed out that caffeine is not some kind of wonder drug, and consuming more does not equate to even more profound benefits. It must be reiterated that the daily recommended dose is 400mg.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t be a bonehead and think that exceeding that amount will equal twice the energy, twice the memory improvement, and so on. Caffeine overdose has been linked to the jitters, anxiety, nausea, rapid heartbeat, insomnia, and dizziness. Too much of it could even prove to be fatal.</p>\n\n<p>As long as you exercise the most important muscle (your brain), common sense will tell when you had enough cup of Joe for the day. You know your body better than anyone else, so you should know just how much caffeine is enough to give you the jolt of energy come gym time.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Be Physically and Mentally at Your Best Before Hitting the Gym</h3>  \n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/22002830/612ATaKVQbL._SL256_.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3457\"><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/22002830/612ATaKVQbL._SL256_.jpg\" alt=\"612ATaKVQbL._SL256_\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It’s rare to be physically and mentally on par come time for a workout.

This post is going to teach you everything you need to know about them.</h3>\nThere is somewhat of a slippery slope when it comes to supplements. Some people feel they are overpriced and overhyped, while others believe muscle gains and fat loss are futile without them.\n\n<strong>Both lines of thinking are flawed. </strong>\n\nSupplements are not magic pills, and if you think they place precedent over your diet and time in the gym, then you’re sorely mistaken.\n\nBy the same token, you’re just as off the mark if you believe supplements are absolutely a money waster. Science has in fact verified the benefits of many ingredients found in performance-enhancing supplements.\n\nWith all this in mind, it’s best that you stick to the basics when picking out a product. Your supplement stack really only needs to consist of no more than a few proven products. The three that will be discussed at length here are: <strong>pre-workout, fat-burners, and BCAAs.</strong>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Pre-workout Supplements for a Supercharged Workout</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/Fotolia_98487069_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5616px) 100vw, 5616px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/Fotolia_98487069_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x163.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/Fotolia_98487069_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x556.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/Fotolia_98487069_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5616w\" alt=\"Muscular body builder lifting weight with energy lights on biceps concept\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Why do most Americans consume coffee before heading off to work? Coffee is a stimulant, or a pick-me-upper as most people refer to it..</p><p>\nThe same goes for a pre-workout supplement taken about 30 minutes prior to exercise. The caffeine from each serving gives you a buzzed sensation where you feel physically and mentally more alert.\n\nThis should not be overlooked because more often than not, people end up skipping their workout session altogether simply because they don’t feel up for it physically.\n\nSure, you can rely on your mental game to force yourself to get into your training session, but why not get a solid boost from an excellent pre-workout product?\n\nMost pre-workout supplements use good ol' caffeine, which fires you up within minutes. Caffeine has been proven time and again in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14572506\">independent studies</a> to fight fatigue and boost cognitive function.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Pre-Workout Supplements: More Than Just an Energy Booster</strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Aside from providing a sustained energy boost, caffeine has also been proven in numerous <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/11474345\">studies</a> to boost athletic performance..</p><p>\nOf course, if this is the case, then why not just chug a cup of Joe or latte? Won’t it have the same effects at a fraction of the cost? Well, as you’re about to see, Pre-workout supplements actually offer two distinct advantages over coffee.\n\n<u>Advantage #1</u>\n\nNot all <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> is created equal. For the most part, the time-honored stimulant falls under two categories: caffeine and caffeine anhydrous.\n\nThe former is basically the variant found abundantly in coffee, tea, chocolate, and the like. The latter is the source in dried form, usually as powder or capsules.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Caffeine anhydrous is the form found in my pre-workout supplement <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a>.</strong>.</p><p>\nAccording to the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20205813\">International Society of Sports Nutrition</a>, anhydrous caffeine <strong>proved to have a more positive effect for athletes engaged in extended, exhaustive exercises.</strong>\n\n<u>Advantage #2</u>\n\nPre-workout supplements also have the benefits of additional scientifically proven ingredients. For example, <strong><a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion’s</a> </strong>specific formulation includes scientifically proven ingredients like<strong><a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\"> creatine monohydrate</a>, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/feeling-lethargic-fight-your-fatigue-with-l-citrulline-malate/\" target=\"_blank\">L-citrulline malate</a>, </strong>and<strong><a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supercharge-your-workouts-with-beta-alanine/\" target=\"_blank\"> beta alanine</a> </strong>just to list a few.\n\nMost weight lifters need no introduction to creatine, <strong>which has long been renowned as a performance enhancer.</strong>\n\nAs for L-citrulline malate, the amino acid<strong> stimulates blood and oxygen flow</strong> to help you acquire a massive pump during heavy bouts of resistance training.\n\nFinally, beta alanine is a key ingredient known for <strong>increasing aerobic endurance, increasing muscle mass, and increasing power output during heavy lifts.</strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Benefits of a Pre-workout Supplement Are Far-Reaching</strong>.</p><p>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/22212534/61Zt6Qk5E5L._SY355_-210x300.jpg\" alt=\"61Zt6Qk5E5L._SY355_\" width=\"181\" height=\"258\" />\n\nAs you can see, the benefits of taking a pre-workout formula go beyond the immediate energy boost. It will increase overall performance for better improvement in strength gains, muscle hypertrophy, and fat loss.\n\nYou should bear in mind, though, that no two pre-workout formulas are exactly alike. Most contain their own secret concoction or propriety blend of ingredients.\n\nWith <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\">Rebellion</a>, however, there’s no unique energy blend with a patented name.

However, fat burners do have a place in your arsenal especially if you’re having trouble losing the last few inches due to hitting a plateau.\n\n<strong>How Do They Work?</strong>\n\nChoosing a fat burner can be a head-spinning affair. There are so many varieties that work via different mechanisms and pathways.\n\nThis includes <strong>raising metabolism, suppressing appetite, blocking carbs from entering the bloodstream, and regulating thyroid function.</strong>\n\nRemember, though, it always comes down to calorie expenditure and not taking in more than your body is burning. With that in mind, the best variety is one that raises body thermogenesis.\n\nAll you need to know about thermogenesis is that it’s the body’s way of regulating its internal temperature. Your goal during a fat loss phase is to raise thermogenesis to elevate metabolism and burn more calories.\n\nThere are a lot of fat burners gracing store shelves that claim to skyrocket metabolism or thermogenesis by 500%, 1,000% or somewhere along the lines of those figures.\n\nObviously, this is all hype based on pseudoscience.

Most people have no clue what the significance of an amino acid profile entails.\n\n<strong>Not all protein are created the same as they’re distinguished by their amino acids</strong>.\n\nThere’s no need to go into all the scientific jargon about the different amino acids that make up the protein molecule. All you need to know is that <strong>some amino acids serve a greater purpose than others</strong>.\n\nThis is especially the case with branched chain amino acids (BCAAs).\n\n<strong>The Layman’s Explanation of BCAAs</strong>\n\nBCAAs are a class of three main amino acids:<strong> leucine, isoleucine,</strong> and <strong>valine</strong>. These three play an invaluable role in muscle retention and growth.\n\nBCAAs are a dieter’s best friend when on a fat loss phase. It’s common knowledge that losing weight requires a calorie deficit. That deficit, however, also eats into some of the muscle.\n\nIt’s an unfortunate reality that muscle loss is part of the territory when trimming down...when there is a lack of calorie intake, <strong>the muscles enter a catabolic state and eat into the amino acids in the muscle for fuel.</strong>\n\nThis is where BCAAs come in and save the day. They are an invaluable component for stimulating protein synthesis, much more so than a high-protein diet alone.\n\nIn laymen speak, they prevent muscle breakdown and the resulting muscle dystrophy.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974721\">study</a> confirms the role BCAAs play in muscle recovery and alleviating soreness.\n\nWhile whey and most other protein sources do contain BCAAs, they are linked to other amino acids and have to be digested before they are able to enter the bloodstream.\n\nBCAAs in supplement form, however, are free-form, meaning <strong>they are not bonded to any other amino acids and are quickly absorbed in the bloodstream</strong> without undergoing a lengthy digestion process.\n\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/REVOLT-bottle-185x300.jpg\" alt=\"REVOLT\" width=\"185\" height=\"300\" />A BCAA supplement is a must if you’re just moving from a muscle building to fat loss phase.\n\nAfter all, you spent so much time busting your butt to acquire every bit of muscle on your frame. It would be a shame to even lose an ounce of what you worked so hard to gain. <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/revolt\" target=\"_blank\">Revolt</a> is a supplement designed to help maximize fat loss while preserving every ounce of heard earned muscle.\n\nOf course, a BCAA supplement alone won’t completely prevent muscle loss. You also have to do your part by maintaining your normal strength training sessions, choosing high-intensity cardio over traditional aerobics, and keeping a food log and adjusting your diet as needed.\n\nWhen all these factors are in place, then that’s when BCAAs can work their magic and provide that extra buffer of protection.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rpf7__C50Y8?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nAs I mention in the video above, it’s a good idea to complement your BCAA supplementation with Glutamine, which is another valuable amino acid that makes up over 60% of your skeletal muscle tissue. This will enhance the prevention of muscle catabolism even further\n\n<strong>What Else Does It Do?</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16181934\">Studies</a> show that BCAAs improve cognitive function in patients with PTSD as well as boost brain power in active <a href=\"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/136/7/2069S.full\">canines</a>. This suggests that BCAAs may have nootropic-like effects as well.\n\nRecent <a href=\"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/141/2/249.full\">studies</a> even suggest BCAAs may prevent weight gain or obesity in middle-aged adults. This really seems to indicate that BCAAs hold multiple benefits beyond their primary purpose.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Make Supplements a Part of Your Training Regimen</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/IMG_3385.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/IMG_3385-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/IMG_3385-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/IMG_3385-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/IMG_3385.jpg 5184w\" alt=\"IMG_3385\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To say that there is a lot of performance enhancing supplements on the market would be an understatement.

Coffee is a stimulant, or a pick-me-upper as most people refer to it..</p><p> <br />\nThe same goes for a pre-workout supplement taken about 30 minutes prior to exercise. The caffeine from each serving gives you a buzzed sensation where you feel physically and mentally more alert.</p>\n\n<p>This should not be overlooked because more often than not, people end up skipping their workout session altogether simply because they don’t feel up for it physically.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, you can rely on your mental game to force yourself to get into your training session, but why not get a solid boost from an excellent pre-workout product?</p>\n\n<p>Most pre-workout supplements use good ol' caffeine, which fires you up within minutes. Caffeine has been proven time and again in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14572506\">independent studies</a> to fight fatigue and boost cognitive function. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Pre-Workout Supplements: More Than Just an Energy Booster</strong>.</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Aside from providing a sustained energy boost, caffeine has also been proven in numerous <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/11474345\">studies</a> to boost athletic performance..</p><p> <br />\nOf course, if this is the case, then why not just chug a cup of Joe or latte? Won’t it have the same effects at a fraction of the cost? Well, as you’re about to see, Pre-workout supplements actually offer two distinct advantages over coffee.</p>\n\n<p><u>Advantage #1</u></p>\n\n<p>Not all <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> is created equal. For the most part, the time-honored stimulant falls under two categories: caffeine and caffeine anhydrous.</p>\n\n<p>The former is basically the variant found abundantly in coffee, tea, chocolate, and the like. The latter is the source in dried form, usually as powder or capsules. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Caffeine anhydrous is the form found in my pre-workout supplement <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a>.</strong>.</p><p> <br />\nAccording to the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20205813\">International Society of Sports Nutrition</a>, anhydrous caffeine <strong>proved to have a more positive effect for athletes engaged in extended, exhaustive exercises.</strong></p>\n\n<p><u>Advantage #2</u></p>\n\n<p>Pre-workout supplements also have the benefits of additional scientifically proven ingredients. For example, <strong><a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion’s</a> </strong>specific formulation includes scientifically proven ingredients like<strong><a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\"> creatine monohydrate</a>, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/feeling-lethargic-fight-your-fatigue-with-l-citrulline-malate/\" target=\"_blank\">L-citrulline malate</a>, </strong>and<strong><a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supercharge-your-workouts-with-beta-alanine/\" target=\"_blank\"> beta alanine</a> </strong>just to list a few.</p>\n\n<p>Most weight lifters need no introduction to creatine, <strong>which has long been renowned as a performance enhancer.</strong></p>\n\n<p>As for L-citrulline malate, the amino acid<strong> stimulates blood and oxygen flow</strong> to help you acquire a massive pump during heavy bouts of resistance training.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, beta alanine is a key ingredient known for <strong>increasing aerobic endurance, increasing muscle mass, and increasing power output during heavy lifts.</strong> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Benefits of a Pre-workout Supplement Are Far-Reaching</strong>.</p><p> <br />\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/22212534/61Zt6Qk5E5L._SY355_-210x300.jpg\" alt=\"61Zt6Qk5E5L._SY355_\" width=\"181\" height=\"258\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the benefits of taking a pre-workout formula go beyond the immediate energy boost.

Most people have no clue what the significance of an amino acid profile entails.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Not all protein are created the same as they’re distinguished by their amino acids</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>There’s no need to go into all the scientific jargon about the different amino acids that make up the protein molecule. All you need to know is that <strong>some amino acids serve a greater purpose than others</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This is especially the case with branched chain amino acids (BCAAs).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Layman’s Explanation of BCAAs</strong></p>\n\n<p>BCAAs are a class of three main amino acids:<strong> leucine, isoleucine,</strong> and <strong>valine</strong>. These three play an invaluable role in muscle retention and growth.</p>\n\n<p>BCAAs are a dieter’s best friend when on a fat loss phase. It’s common knowledge that losing weight requires a calorie deficit. That deficit, however, also eats into some of the muscle.</p>\n\n<p>It’s an unfortunate reality that muscle loss is part of the territory when trimming down...when there is a lack of calorie intake, <strong>the muscles enter a catabolic state and eat into the amino acids in the muscle for fuel.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is where BCAAs come in and save the day. They are an invaluable component for stimulating protein synthesis, much more so than a high-protein diet alone.</p>\n\n<p>In laymen speak, they prevent muscle breakdown and the resulting muscle dystrophy.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974721\">study</a> confirms the role BCAAs play in muscle recovery and alleviating soreness.</p>\n\n<p>While whey and most other protein sources do contain BCAAs, they are linked to other amino acids and have to be digested before they are able to enter the bloodstream.</p>\n\n<p>BCAAs in supplement form, however, are free-form, meaning <strong>they are not bonded to any other amino acids and are quickly absorbed in the bloodstream</strong> without undergoing a lengthy digestion process.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/REVOLT-bottle-185x300.jpg\" alt=\"REVOLT\" width=\"185\" height=\"300\" />A BCAA supplement is a must if you’re just moving from a muscle building to fat loss phase.</p>\n\n<p>After all, you spent so much time busting your butt to acquire every bit of muscle on your frame. It would be a shame to even lose an ounce of what you worked so hard to gain. <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/revolt\" target=\"_blank\">Revolt</a> is a supplement designed to help maximize fat loss while preserving every ounce of heard earned muscle.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, a BCAA supplement alone won’t completely prevent muscle loss. You also have to do your part by maintaining your normal strength training sessions, choosing high-intensity cardio over traditional aerobics, and keeping a food log and adjusting your diet as needed.</p>\n\n<p>When all these factors are in place, then that’s when BCAAs can work their magic and provide that extra buffer of protection.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rpf7__C50Y8?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<p>As I mention in the video above, it’s a good idea to complement your BCAA supplementation with Glutamine, which is another valuable amino acid that makes up over 60% of your skeletal muscle tissue. This will enhance the prevention of muscle catabolism even further</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Else Does It Do?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16181934\">Studies</a> show that BCAAs improve cognitive function in patients with PTSD as well as boost brain power in active <a href=\"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/136/7/2069S.full\">canines</a>. This suggests that BCAAs may have nootropic-like effects as well.</p>\n\n<p>Recent <a href=\"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/141/2/249.full\">studies</a> even suggest BCAAs may prevent weight gain or obesity in middle-aged adults.

Healthy diet and weight loss.\" />\n\nAs I’ve said many times before, <strong>spot reducing doesn’t work and has been debunked by science</strong>. Focus on fat loss in general as opposed to losing fat specifically from your legs. I assure you the cellulite will come off if you shift your emphasis on a total body routine.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Try This</h3>\nWhen it comes to cardio, you can probably guess that I’m going to recommend <a href=\"http://directhiit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HIIT</a>.\n\nYep, this is definitely what I highly advise doing for <strong>boosting your metabolism and burning fat.</strong> However, when it comes to developing muscular and toned legs, you want to build some muscle in the area as well.\n\nThis is why I recommend HIIT using uphill or incline sprints. This can be done either outside where there’s a hill, or on the treadmill with an incline setting.\n\nThis builds muscle in the calf area, which is just as susceptible to fat accumulation as the thighs. The movement also works your hamstrings and glutes.\n\nDo this using a typical HIIT format; that is, 20-30 seconds of incline sprinting followed by a 20-second rest. Keep repeating the process until you hit 15-20 minutes.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What About Strength Training?</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL.jpg 5446w\" alt=\"Woman on training apparatus in sports club. Fitness\" />\n\nFor strength training, you will continue to train the way I normally outline. This means low volume compound exercises. You will gain some muscle out of it, enough to give you a slight metabolism boost, but not so much that you turn into a beefed up chick (unless, of course, you take synthetic steroids).\n\nIf you really want to tone up your legs, then <strong>make squats and lunges a focal point of your workout</strong>. This will help build muscle as well as lose fat everywhere, not just on your legs.\n\nOnce the cellulite around the thighs comes off, the muscles will show and add definition to your lower body.\n<h3>Achieve Toned Legs With My Training Method</h3>\nRemember, <strong>you can’t spot reduce, so you’re going to have to focus on total fat loss</strong>. Forget focusing solely on a specific problem area, be it on your legs or elsewhere.\n\nWith that in mind, I do recommend variations to your HIIT training, which I outlined earlier, if you want to know how to really lose leg fat and develop muscle in the area.\n\nOn a final note, achieving amazing fat loss results can be amplified and sped up with a product like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\">Tea Rexx</a>.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/29225636/download.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"277\" height=\"278\" /></strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>When combined with HIIT and the right diet, <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a> will help you acquire your desired body, one that you will be proud to strut in a bikini or tight yoga shorts.</strong>.</p><p>\"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">People tend to have stubborn fat in certain areas.

As a result, a lot of ladies feel really self-conscious when wearing shorts or swim suits.</p>\n\n<p>So, how do you lose stubborn leg fat and achieve toned lower limbs?  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Focus on Fat Loss as a Whole</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_96527371_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x464.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_96527371_Subscription_Monthly_XL-150x68.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_96527371_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x136.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_96527371_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x464.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_96527371_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg 5514w\" alt=\"Young woman with scales. Healthy diet and weight loss.\" /></p>\n\n<p>As I’ve said many times before, <strong>spot reducing doesn’t work and has been debunked by science</strong>. Focus on fat loss in general as opposed to losing fat specifically from your legs. I assure you the cellulite will come off if you shift your emphasis on a total body routine.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Try This</h3>  \n\n<p>When it comes to cardio, you can probably guess that I’m going to recommend <a href=\"http://directhiit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HIIT</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yep, this is definitely what I highly advise doing for <strong>boosting your metabolism and burning fat.</strong> However, when it comes to developing muscular and toned legs, you want to build some muscle in the area as well.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I recommend HIIT using uphill or incline sprints. This can be done either outside where there’s a hill, or on the treadmill with an incline setting.</p>\n\n<p>This builds muscle in the calf area, which is just as susceptible to fat accumulation as the thighs. The movement also works your hamstrings and glutes.</p>\n\n<p>Do this using a typical HIIT format; that is, 20-30 seconds of incline sprinting followed by a 20-second rest. Keep repeating the process until you hit 15-20 minutes.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What About Strength Training?</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL.jpg 5446w\" alt=\"Woman on training apparatus in sports club. Fitness\" /></p>\n\n<p>For strength training, you will continue to train the way I normally outline. This means low volume compound exercises. You will gain some muscle out of it, enough to give you a slight metabolism boost, but not so much that you turn into a beefed up chick (unless, of course, you take synthetic steroids).</p>\n\n<p>If you really want to tone up your legs, then <strong>make squats and lunges a focal point of your workout</strong>. This will help build muscle as well as lose fat everywhere, not just on your legs.</p>\n\n<p>Once the cellulite around the thighs comes off, the muscles will show and add definition to your lower body.  </p>\n\n<h3>Achieve Toned Legs With My Training Method</h3>  \n\n<p>Remember, <strong>you can’t spot reduce, so you’re going to have to focus on total fat loss</strong>. Forget focusing solely on a specific problem area, be it on your legs or elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, I do recommend variations to your HIIT training, which I outlined earlier, if you want to know how to really lose leg fat and develop muscle in the area.</p>\n\n<p>On a final note, achieving amazing fat loss results can be amplified and sped up with a product like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\">Tea Rexx</a>. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/29225636/download.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"277\" height=\"278\" /></strong>.</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>When combined with HIIT and the right diet, <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a> will help you acquire your desired body, one that you will be proud to strut in a bikini or tight yoga shorts.</strong>.</p><p>\"</p>","amp":null,"image":"//media.brandoncarter.com/2016/01/Pasted-image-at-2016_06_27-05_42-PM.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-01-07 11:00:40","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-01-07 11:00:40","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-01-07 11:00:40","published_by":1},{"id":2287,"uuid":"0b292d5b-ade3-46a9-8952-d0b312b166e6","title":"Inexpensive Healthy Meals: Eat Like a Champion Without Breaking the Bank","slug":"inexpensive-healthy-meals-eat-like-a-champion-without-breaking-the-bank","markdown":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Eating healthy is often associated with spending lots of money.

Here are 7 common mistakes I see when looking for and buying a fat burner supplement.</h3>\nAcquiring six-pack abs doesn’t come without invested time, sweat, and dedication. That’s just the cold and blunt truth.\n\nFat loss supplements are by no means a shortcut, and if you believe you can ease up on your cardio and diet because you just purchased the latest fat loss supplement with some new super ingredient, then you’re going to be sorely disappointed.\n\nWith that said, though, a <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">fat burner</a> certainly has a place among your supplementation. You have to be smart in your selection and pick a fat burner based on scientific studies and your individual needs. Too many people get overly eager and buy whatever supplement happens to be the newest release.\n\nHere are 7 mistakes that are all too common when selecting a fat burner to add among your supplement stack.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #1: Selecting a Fat Burner With Unproven Ingredients</h3>\nThis applies to any supplement but especially with fat burners.\n\nHere’s the fact about the supplement industry: its main goal is profit, and to continuously make more money, they have to continuously release new products. To pique interest in a new supplement, it has to contain some novel ingredient or formula.\n\nIf you keep up with bodybuilding news, there is practically a new fat burner released every few months, each claiming to be superior than its predecessors because of some newly discovered ingredient.\n\nThe ingredient in question is then given a lengthy report that encompasses the next four to five pages in a fitness magazine.\n\nThis includes text with a lot of scientific jargon, photos of the supposed scientists behind the research, and charts illustrating how effective the ingredient is compared to a placebo or conventional ingredients.\n\nHere’s the deal with these supposed “breakthrough” ingredients; most of them are based on very little research, and often the research is flawed in some way, such as not having a large enough sample, not being double blind, not accounting for pre-existing conditions like current health, etc.\n\nThere should be multiple studies available that can be found in scientific journals. Company-funded studies do not constitute a reliable and independent study.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Stick With Tried and Proven Ingredients</strong>.</p><p>\nThis isn’t to say you should automatically discount new ingredients. It’s just to say you should wait for more research to come out. Until then, stick with ingredients that have withstood the test of time and have multiple, independent scientific sources backing it up.\n\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/rejuvenate-body-proven-power-green-tea-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">Green tea</a>, for example, has numerous sources verifying its effects as an effective fat loss booster. Here is one <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17882140\">study</a> from Denmark that proves the thermogenic effects of green tea due to its <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> and catechins content, each of which has a sleuth of studies of their own.\n\nAn independent <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16076989\">clinical study</a> in the fat loss benefits of caffeine can be found here, while this <a href=\"http://www.nutraingredients.com/Research/Green-tea-catechins-linked-to-weight-loss-Study\">study</a> verifies the validity of catechins as a weight loss aid.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #2: Not Choosing a Fat Burner That Is Right for Your Specific Needs</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/What-Is-DHEA-and-Why-Is-It-the-Key-to-Sending-Your-Testosterone-Production-Into-Overdrive-7-1024x601.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/What-Is-DHEA-and-Why-Is-It-the-Key-to-Sending-Your-Testosterone-Production-Into-Overdrive-7-150x88.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/What-Is-DHEA-and-Why-Is-It-the-Key-to-Sending-Your-Testosterone-Production-Into-Overdrive-7-300x176.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/What-Is-DHEA-and-Why-Is-It-the-Key-to-Sending-Your-Testosterone-Production-Into-Overdrive-7-1024x601.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/What-Is-DHEA-and-Why-Is-It-the-Key-to-Sending-Your-Testosterone-Production-Into-Overdrive-7.jpg 5985w\" alt=\"Strong muscular man taking diet supplements or pharmaceutical medication standing shirtless with his mouth open and head tilted back as he drops a pill from his hand or places something in his mouth\" />\n\nFat burners work via multiple mechanisms, such as:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Raising thermogenesis</li>\n \t<li>Suppressing appetite</li>\n \t<li>Blocking the absorption of carbs</li>\n \t<li>Blocking the absorption of fat</li>\n \t<li>Inhibiting the production of cortisol</li>\n</ul>\nYou have to select a product that is fitting for where you’re currently at in your fat loss goals.\n\nDoes your plan include regular intermittent fasting?

A site like <a href=\"http://www.consumerlab.com/\">Consumer Lab</a> is a good place to start.\n\nThis also doesn’t mean that you should automatically gravitate towards more well-known (and Pricier) brands. It is unnecessary to pay extra for a leading brand. The extra cost is hardly ever due to superior ingredients; it’s almost always due to the heavy advertisements and endorsements.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #7: Trying to Acquire the Ingredients Soley From Whole Foods</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/Fotolia_79493110_Subscription_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/Fotolia_79493110_Subscription_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/Fotolia_79493110_Subscription_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/Fotolia_79493110_Subscription_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/Fotolia_79493110_Subscription_XXL.jpg 5760w\" alt=\"448427\" />\n\nIn an effort to save money, some people may ditch a fat burning supplement altogether and try to acquire their daily intake of common fat loss ingredients from food.\n\nIt’s true that nutrients from whole foods are typically better (but not always) than the nutrient derived in pill or powder form.</p><p>However, this solution may not always be practical.\n\nTake <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">creatine</a>, for example; this organic acid is found naturally in foods like fish and red meat. However, you would have to ingest about 500g of meat/fish a day to get the amount of creatine you would get from a single scoop of creatine in supplement form.\n\nThe same goes for a lot of the ingredients found in a fat burner. <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a> contains <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/raspberry-ketones-natures-fountain-youth/\" target=\"_blank\">raspberry ketones</a>, another ingredient heralded for its fat loss benefits.\n\nAs you can probably guess, raspberry ketones can be found in raspberries as well as in other fruits. Here’s the problem, though: you would have to consume roughly 90 pounds of raspberries a day to get the amount of ketones you would from a single serving of a ketone supplement.\n\nWith this in mind, it’s obvious why not all ingredients can be acquired in the optimal dosages from food alone.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Make an Informed Decision</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/29225636/download.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"294\" height=\"295\" />If you read up to this point, then more than likely you’re trying to shape up.

Too many people get overly eager and buy whatever supplement happens to be the newest release.</p>\n\n<p>Here are 7 mistakes that are all too common when selecting a fat burner to add among your supplement stack.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #1: Selecting a Fat Burner With Unproven Ingredients</h3>  \n\n<p>This applies to any supplement but especially with fat burners.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the fact about the supplement industry: its main goal is profit, and to continuously make more money, they have to continuously release new products. To pique interest in a new supplement, it has to contain some novel ingredient or formula.</p>\n\n<p>If you keep up with bodybuilding news, there is practically a new fat burner released every few months, each claiming to be superior than its predecessors because of some newly discovered ingredient.</p>\n\n<p>The ingredient in question is then given a lengthy report that encompasses the next four to five pages in a fitness magazine.</p>\n\n<p>This includes text with a lot of scientific jargon, photos of the supposed scientists behind the research, and charts illustrating how effective the ingredient is compared to a placebo or conventional ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the deal with these supposed “breakthrough” ingredients; most of them are based on very little research, and often the research is flawed in some way, such as not having a large enough sample, not being double blind, not accounting for pre-existing conditions like current health, etc.</p>\n\n<p>There should be multiple studies available that can be found in scientific journals. Company-funded studies do not constitute a reliable and independent study. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Stick With Tried and Proven Ingredients</strong>.</p><p> <br />\nThis isn’t to say you should automatically discount new ingredients. It’s just to say you should wait for more research to come out.

Human face expression\" /></p>\n\n<p>I can understand wanting to save money on supplements, but you do need to research the company to be sure the brand does not have a shady history of unethical practices.</p>\n\n<p>Case in point is the multi-vitamin industry, which suffered a major black eye back in 2011 when a <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43429680/ns/health-diet_and_nutrition/t/many-multivitamins-dont-have-nutrients-claimed-label/#.VoCSFxUrLIU\">laboratory study</a> revealed that eight of the 38 multi-vitamin products tested contained far below the dosage listed on the label.</p>\n\n<p>Another two actually contained more than was listed on its label, which is just as bad because it puts the consumer at risk of overdosing.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of the vitamins with inaccurate labelling was actually from generic and store brands.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t to paint all generic supplement brands in a broad brush, but it definitely shows that you have to actively scout for unbiased product reviews. A site like <a href=\"http://www.consumerlab.com/\">Consumer Lab</a> is a good place to start.</p>\n\n<p>This also doesn’t mean that you should automatically gravitate towards more well-known (and Pricier) brands. It is unnecessary to pay extra for a leading brand. The extra cost is hardly ever due to superior ingredients; it’s almost always due to the heavy advertisements and endorsements.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #7: Trying to Acquire the Ingredients Soley From Whole Foods</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/Fotolia_79493110_Subscription_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/Fotolia_79493110_Subscription_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/Fotolia_79493110_Subscription_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/Fotolia_79493110_Subscription_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08110059/Fotolia_79493110_Subscription_XXL.jpg 5760w\" alt=\"448427\" /></p>\n\n<p>In an effort to save money, some people may ditch a fat burning supplement altogether and try to acquire their daily intake of common fat loss ingredients from food.</p>\n\n<p>It’s true that nutrients from whole foods are typically better (but not always) than the nutrient derived in pill or powder form.</p><p>However, this solution may not always be practical.</p>\n\n<p>Take <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">creatine</a>, for example; this organic acid is found naturally in foods like fish and red meat. However, you would have to ingest about 500g of meat/fish a day to get the amount of creatine you would get from a single scoop of creatine in supplement form.</p>\n\n<p>The same goes for a lot of the ingredients found in a fat burner. <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a> contains <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/raspberry-ketones-natures-fountain-youth/\" target=\"_blank\">raspberry ketones</a>, another ingredient heralded for its fat loss benefits.</p>\n\n<p>As you can probably guess, raspberry ketones can be found in raspberries as well as in other fruits. Here’s the problem, though: you would have to consume roughly 90 pounds of raspberries a day to get the amount of ketones you would from a single serving of a ketone supplement.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, it’s obvious why not all ingredients can be acquired in the optimal dosages from food alone.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Make an Informed Decision</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/29225636/download.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"294\" height=\"295\" />If you read up to this point, then more than likely you’re trying to shape up.

The road isn’t going to be easy, though. There will be many moments of eating bland foods and digging deep to get through a vomit-inducing workout.\n\nWhile there is no way around this, including of a fat burning supplement does give you an added boost and help shed the last few pounds that are resisting every effort to come off.\n\nAnother thing about fat burners is that they contain a host of other benefits besides helping you achieve body fat percentages in the single digit range.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #1: Fat Burners Help You Break Out of a Plateau</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_71540599_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_71540599_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_71540599_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_71540599_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_71540599_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5616w\" alt=\"Young woman dissapointed on a medical weight scale.\" />\n\nHitting a plateau is virtually guaranteed and just about everyone who aspires to build muscle or lose fat has experienced it at one point or another.\n\nWhen it comes to fat loss specifically, you will usually see immediate results within the first two to four weeks before the results begin to taper down and you hit the plateau. At this point, your regimen only serves to help you maintain the results you already acquired.\n\nWhile body fat percentages differ depending on factors like gender, age, and genetics, every person has a natural “comfort zone” that their body likes to remain in.\n\nFor the average male, the body has body fat levels in the comfort zone of around 12-20%. If they manage to break out of the plateau and get to about 8% (a very impressive feat), then they will usually hit another plateau and have to continue to tweak their fitness plan if they hope to reach the single digit percentages.\n\nFor females – who naturally carry more body fat than their male counterparts – the body’s comfort zone is usually around 21% to 24% and 14% to 17%.\n\nPlateaus are a challenge to break out of, but they can be done with modifications to your lifestyle, such as adding an additional day of HIIT cardio, cutting out more calories, and incorporating intermittent fasting.\n\nThe other solution is to add a <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">fat burner</a> to your supplementation. Most contain ingredients like <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> or <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/rejuvenate-body-proven-power-green-tea-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">green tea</a>, both of which are known for their energy enhancing and thermogenic effects.\n\nThis should help elevate your metabolism just a little bit more and beyond what you’re able to do through exercise and dieting alone.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #2: Fat Burners Help You Lose Fat Directly and Indirectly</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_80046624_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_80046624_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_80046624_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_80046624_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_80046624_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5616w\" alt=\"successful weight loss, white background, diet concept\" />\n\n<strong>The main way the body puts on fat is by taking in more calories than it burns off</strong>. Factors like the amount of food you eat and lack of physical activity are the prime contributors of weight gain.\n\nHowever, there are other conditions that cause the body to store fat in a more indirect manner. One such condition is stress, which is known to stimulate the hypothalamus and trigger the release of cortisol.\n\nToo much cortisol is <strong>known for increasing belly fat and also makes you crave sugar</strong>, thereby causing you to eat more of the foods you shouldn’t be eating outside of your cheat day.\n\nMost fat burners help you lose fat directly by raising your metabolism; it also helps indirectly. <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>, specifically, contains <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/rejuvenate-body-proven-power-green-tea-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">green tea extract</a> as a primary ingredient. Green tea herbs have been shown in this <a href=\"http://adrenalfatiguesolution.com/green-tea-can-relieve-stress/\">study</a> to reduce psychological stress by up to 20%!\n\nAccording to the Statistic Brain Research Institute, <strong>77% of Americans reported experiencing physical symptoms associated with stress.</strong> While discussing stress may appear to be veering off topic, it really isn’t because more <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-mindful-self-express/201308/why-we-gain-weight-when-we-re-stressed-and-how-not\">studies</a> are connecting the dots between stress and weight gain.\n\nSupplementing with a fat burner will certainly alleviate some anxiety, but you also need to be sure to take better care of yourself to promote a sense of well-being.\n\nMore <a href=\"http://www.todaysgeriatricmedicine.com/archive/110310p16.shtml\">studies</a> are linking mental and emotional health to physical ailments like diabetes and heart disease; it’s really not just donuts and bacon cheeseburgers that lead to weight gain and preventable diseases.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #3: It Supercharges You</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_91874569_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x791.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_91874569_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x116.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_91874569_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x232.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_91874569_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x791.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_91874569_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5800w\" alt=\"Businessman opens shirt with abs of fire\" />\n\n<strong>Fat burners also have a secondary benefit as an energy booster</strong>. Given that <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> is often a primary ingredients, it’s only natural that each serving gives you a jolt of energy that’s not later accompanied by a crash.\n\nFat burners like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a> also contain additional ingredients, such as yerba mate, which is also known for containing caffeine along with theobromine, <strong>a much lesser-known but equally powerful stimulant</strong>.\n\nSince most fat burners are taken two to three times a day, this means you get a timed dose of energy to keep you alert throughout the day. This means no more of the dreaded 2:30 slump at work or the fatigue in the late afternoon that makes you question going to the gym.\n\nIf you take both a pre-workout formula and a fat burner, then be sure the total caffeine dosage does not exceed around 400mg. Taking both is enough to provide ample energy to get you through an entire day.\n\nTo ensure you don’t go over the daily dosage, keep caffeinated beverages like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/fighter-fuel?variant=14954915207\" target=\"_blank\">coffee</a> to a minimum.\n\nBear in mind that caffeine is also in foods that you may not normally expect to contain the stimulant. This includes coffee and chocolate flavored foods, and even decaffeinated drinks, which surprisingly, isn’t always 100% caffeine-free.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #4: It Helps You Get a Good Night Sleep</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_72180734_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_72180734_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_72180734_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_72180734_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_72180734_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5616w\" alt=\"Beautiful girl sleeps in the bedroom, lying on bed, isolated\" />\n\nIt kind of seems contradictory that a fat burner would promote sleep given that it contains stimulants like <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a>. <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/rejuvenate-body-proven-power-green-tea-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">Green tea</a>, though, has actually been proven in a <a href=\"http://www.nutraingredients.com/Research/Green-tea-lulls-brain-into-quality-sleep\">study in Japan</a> to stimulate the release of L-theanine.\n\nThis amino acid is believed to <strong>promote a sense of calm and fostering a relaxed state</strong>. Subjects who consumed green tea reported improved sleep quality, less nightmares, and better mental clarity before going to bed.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ginseng is another herb that has long been used in China as a sedative and proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23872254\">study</a> to improve sleep quality in sleep-disturbed subjects. This is why I included both green tea and ginseng in <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>..</p><p>\nLike stress, lack of sleep or poor sleep quality has been shown in <a href=\"http://www.rd.com/health/diet-weight-loss/why-lack-of-sleep-could-be-making-you-fatter/\">studies</a> to cause weight gain. <strong>The research revealed that those who sleep less also tend to eat more</strong>.\n\nSleep deprivation also slows metabolism, which the body does to conserve energy. When the body thinks it needs more energy, it releases cortisol, a hormone that increases appetite.\n\nOn top of that, a sleep-deprived body also releases more ghrelin, another hormone <strong>notorious for increasing hunger</strong>. The body also produces less leptin, which signals your body that it’s full.\n\nAlso, the body actually burns the majority of calories while it’s in deep REM sleep. Less sleep means less time spent in REM.\n\nLess sleep is also associated with a number of other health problems, all of which themselves may also have an indirect effect on your weight.\n\nLack of sleep causes fatigue, which in turn diminishes physical performance in the gym. Little sleep also weakens the immune system; a body that’s less than fully healthy cannot optimally burn fat or build muscle.\n\nA good fat burner has an ingredient or two known for helping you get in your nighttime Zs, something that more people are getting increasingly less of due to a hectic lifestyle that demands more of their waking hours.\n\nThe ingredients mentioned are also all-natural and nothing like synthetic sleeping pills that carries a host of side effects.\n\nDue to the caffeine content, refrain from taking a fat burner before bedtime. The last dosage should be in the late afternoon or early evening.\n\nEven if you are unable to get the optimal eight hours of shuteye, try not to go below five hours as a <a href=\"http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/consequences/sleep-and-disease-risk\">Harvard Medical School study</a> showed that subjects that consistently slept for five hours or less <strong>elevated their risk of death from all causes by 15%</strong>.\n\nIf you need more sleep, consider taking mini power naps of about 10-20 minutes.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #5: Fat Burners Are Chockful of Antioxidants</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_64625103_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_64625103_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_64625103_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_64625103_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_64625103_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5616w\" alt=\"Blueberry antioxidant organic superfood in a bowl concept for healthy eating and nutrition\" />\n\nFat burners also deliver an abundant dose of antioxidants for boosting overall health. This should not be overlooked because fitness should be about general health just as much as it is about acquiring chiseled abs.\n\nLuckily, supplements like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a> contain natural ingredients that have long been used as medicinal herbs. Recent research also hints that <strong>antioxidants may play a vital role in fat loss</strong>.\n\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/rejuvenate-body-proven-power-green-tea-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">Green tea</a> is especially known for a class of antioxidants known as polyphenols critical for fighting harmful free radicals. Some polyphenols are also believed to stimulate the production of an enzyme called activated protein kinase (AMPK). This enzyme is vital for helping your body maintain a high metabolism by regulating sugar use.\n\nAside from green tea, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/green-coffee-bean-extract-its-coffee-2-0-in-pill-form/\" target=\"_blank\">green coffee bean extract</a> is another potent source of antioxidants. Green coffee bean differs from traditional black coffee as the former contains high concentrations of chlorogenic acid.\n\nAmong its many benefits, chlorogenic acid is <strong>known for stabilizing blood sugar levels</strong>. It’s also believed to aid in the metabolism of glucose and reducing the absorption of carbohydrates, thus reducing sudden insulin spikes that can lead to diabetes.\n\nBest of all, for weight loss seekers, <strong>chlorogenic acid may also aid in fat loss</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16545124\">Studies</a> suggest that the antioxidant aids in the production of the hormone adiponectin, which is known for assisting in fat loss and preventing the storage of fat in the liver.\n\nBear in mind that Chlorogenic acid can only be obtained from <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/green-coffee-bean-extract-its-coffee-2-0-in-pill-form/\" target=\"_blank\">green coffee bean extract</a> in supplement form. Green coffee bean as a drink contains very little of the antioxidant due to most of the compound being destroyed when the beans are roasted.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"> Benefit #6: Fat Burners Increase Physical Output</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/IMG_6724-1024x690.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/IMG_6724-150x101.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/IMG_6724-300x202.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/IMG_6724-1024x690.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/IMG_6724.jpg 4351w\" alt=\"IMG_6724\" />\n\nTo see results and break through plateaus, you have to train to the max with respects to both cardio and strength training. Training to semi-failure will only yield semi-results; semi-results do not yield ripped abs.\n\nOf course, reaching absolute failure is easier said than done. <strong>This is another area where a fat burner may come in handy.</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">Caffeine</a> has been shown in <a href=\"http://coffeeandhealth.org/topic-overview/caffeine-and-performance-in-short-term-high-intensity-anaerobic-exercise/\">studies</a> to increase performance in short-term, high-intensity exercise. Research also suggested that the performance-enhancing benefits of caffeine are amplified when consumed in an anhydrous (pill or powder form) state as opposed to the variety found in coffee.\n\nWith <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>, you don’t just get a caffeine kick. You also get a dose of multiple herbal extracts. One such herb is rhodiola rosea, which, like caffeine, has also been demonstrated in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15256690\">studies</a> to improve performance during exercise.\n\nIf training short of failure was enough for achieving great results, then much more people would be sporting a six-pack. To help you achieve peak performance every time you hit the weight room or perform HIIT cardio, take a fat burner. It just might help you push yourself to a new level.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #7: Fat Burners Increase Testosterone</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_85721523_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x672.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_85721523_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x197.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_85721523_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x672.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_85721523_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg 2832w\" alt=\"Strong bodybuilder uses nutritional supplements\" />\n\nFat burners are designed for trimming down and definitely not intended for building muscle mass. However, muscle gains may very well be among the many secondary benefits.\n\nSome of the ingredients commonly found in fat loss supplements are <strong>known for increasing free testosterone levels</strong>. Such as is the case with ginseng, found in many weight loss and energy products.\n\nGinseng, as it turns out, is a known testosterone booster as proven in this <a href=\"http://iast.net/testosterone-booster-ingredients/ginseng-benefits-side-effects/\">study</a>. The herb is believed to stimulate the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for producing sex hormones.\n\nFor men especially, a high testosterone count is important not just for maintaining muscle mass but also for keeping fat levels in check. <strong>There is a strong correlation between testosterone deficiency and obesity</strong>.\n\nThose prescribed testosterone replacement therapy have also reported fat loss. Furthermore, this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25105998\">study</a> backs up the claims of testosterone as an essential component of weight loss.\n\nFor women, the thoughts of elevated testosterone may be concerning since most prefer to lose fat while keeping muscle gain to a minimum.\n\nReally, there is no need to worry since females do not naturally produce testosterone at the rate men do. Even if their testosterone levels do increase slightly, that’s actually a good thing as a bit of muscle gain, say, 5lbs, <strong>is beneficial because it increases body definition and aids in fat loss.</strong>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #8: Fat Burners Suppress Appetite</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Intermittent-Fasting-What-Is-It-and-What-Does-It-Do-To-Your-Testosterone-5-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Intermittent-Fasting-What-Is-It-and-What-Does-It-Do-To-Your-Testosterone-5-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Intermittent-Fasting-What-Is-It-and-What-Does-It-Do-To-Your-Testosterone-5-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Intermittent-Fasting-What-Is-It-and-What-Does-It-Do-To-Your-Testosterone-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Intermittent-Fasting-What-Is-It-and-What-Does-It-Do-To-Your-Testosterone-5.jpg 5616w\" alt=\"A woman on a gluten free diet is saying no thanks to toast\" />\n\nCutting back on calories is a staple part of any fat loss program. Of course, with calorie restriction comes hunger. This is actually the part where most people drop the ball.\n\nWhen the hunger becomes too much, <strong>not only do they abandon their fitness regimen but they often end up eating more and putting on more weight</strong>. The end result is the yo-yo dieting effect where the weight that was successfully loss is gained back and then some.\n\nTips like drinking more water, chewing gum, and allowing yourself a cheat day certainly helps, but it doesn’t always quell the demands of an empty belly growling at you for not feeding it.\n\nIf you’re on a calorie-restricted diet, then a <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">fat burner</a> can help as some of the ingredients are known for suppressing appetite.\n\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/rejuvenate-body-proven-power-green-tea-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">Green tea extract</a> is taken as a common appetite suppressant. <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">Caffeine</a> is also known for controlling appetite, as is the amino acid L-carnitine.\n\nConsumption of <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/fighter-fuel?variant=14954915207\" target=\"_blank\">coffee</a>, in fact, is a nifty trick if you are prone to overeating during meals.

At this point, your regimen only serves to help you maintain the results you already acquired.</p>\n\n<p>While body fat percentages differ depending on factors like gender, age, and genetics, every person has a natural “comfort zone” that their body likes to remain in.</p>\n\n<p>For the average male, the body has body fat levels in the comfort zone of around 12-20%. If they manage to break out of the plateau and get to about 8% (a very impressive feat), then they will usually hit another plateau and have to continue to tweak their fitness plan if they hope to reach the single digit percentages.</p>\n\n<p>For females – who naturally carry more body fat than their male counterparts – the body’s comfort zone is usually around 21% to 24% and 14% to 17%.</p>\n\n<p>Plateaus are a challenge to break out of, but they can be done with modifications to your lifestyle, such as adding an additional day of HIIT cardio, cutting out more calories, and incorporating intermittent fasting.</p>\n\n<p>The other solution is to add a <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">fat burner</a> to your supplementation.

Factors like the amount of food you eat and lack of physical activity are the prime contributors of weight gain.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are other conditions that cause the body to store fat in a more indirect manner. One such condition is stress, which is known to stimulate the hypothalamus and trigger the release of cortisol.</p>\n\n<p>Too much cortisol is <strong>known for increasing belly fat and also makes you crave sugar</strong>, thereby causing you to eat more of the foods you shouldn’t be eating outside of your cheat day.</p>\n\n<p>Most fat burners help you lose fat directly by raising your metabolism; it also helps indirectly. <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>, specifically, contains <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/rejuvenate-body-proven-power-green-tea-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">green tea extract</a> as a primary ingredient.

This means no more of the dreaded 2:30 slump at work or the fatigue in the late afternoon that makes you question going to the gym.</p>\n\n<p>If you take both a pre-workout formula and a fat burner, then be sure the total caffeine dosage does not exceed around 400mg. Taking both is enough to provide ample energy to get you through an entire day.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure you don’t go over the daily dosage, keep caffeinated beverages like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/fighter-fuel?variant=14954915207\" target=\"_blank\">coffee</a> to a minimum.</p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that caffeine is also in foods that you may not normally expect to contain the stimulant.

When the body thinks it needs more energy, it releases cortisol, a hormone that increases appetite.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, a sleep-deprived body also releases more ghrelin, another hormone <strong>notorious for increasing hunger</strong>. The body also produces less leptin, which signals your body that it’s full.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the body actually burns the majority of calories while it’s in deep REM sleep. Less sleep means less time spent in REM.</p>\n\n<p>Less sleep is also associated with a number of other health problems, all of which themselves may also have an indirect effect on your weight.</p>\n\n<p>Lack of sleep causes fatigue, which in turn diminishes physical performance in the gym. Little sleep also weakens the immune system; a body that’s less than fully healthy cannot optimally burn fat or build muscle.</p>\n\n<p>A good fat burner has an ingredient or two known for helping you get in your nighttime Zs, something that more people are getting increasingly less of due to a hectic lifestyle that demands more of their waking hours.</p>\n\n<p>The ingredients mentioned are also all-natural and nothing like synthetic sleeping pills that carries a host of side effects.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the caffeine content, refrain from taking a fat burner before bedtime. The last dosage should be in the late afternoon or early evening.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you are unable to get the optimal eight hours of shuteye, try not to go below five hours as a <a href=\"http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/consequences/sleep-and-disease-risk\">Harvard Medical School study</a> showed that subjects that consistently slept for five hours or less <strong>elevated their risk of death from all causes by 15%</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If you need more sleep, consider taking mini power naps of about 10-20 minutes.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #5: Fat Burners Are Chockful of Antioxidants</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_64625103_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_64625103_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_64625103_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_64625103_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_64625103_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5616w\" alt=\"Blueberry antioxidant organic superfood in a bowl concept for healthy eating and nutrition\" /></p>\n\n<p>Fat burners also deliver an abundant dose of antioxidants for boosting overall health. This should not be overlooked because fitness should be about general health just as much as it is about acquiring chiseled abs.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily, supplements like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a> contain natural ingredients that have long been used as medicinal herbs. Recent research also hints that <strong>antioxidants may play a vital role in fat loss</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/rejuvenate-body-proven-power-green-tea-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">Green tea</a> is especially known for a class of antioxidants known as polyphenols critical for fighting harmful free radicals. Some polyphenols are also believed to stimulate the production of an enzyme called activated protein kinase (AMPK). This enzyme is vital for helping your body maintain a high metabolism by regulating sugar use.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from green tea, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/green-coffee-bean-extract-its-coffee-2-0-in-pill-form/\" target=\"_blank\">green coffee bean extract</a> is another potent source of antioxidants. Green coffee bean differs from traditional black coffee as the former contains high concentrations of chlorogenic acid.</p>\n\n<p>Among its many benefits, chlorogenic acid is <strong>known for stabilizing blood sugar levels</strong>. It’s also believed to aid in the metabolism of glucose and reducing the absorption of carbohydrates, thus reducing sudden insulin spikes that can lead to diabetes.</p>\n\n<p>Best of all, for weight loss seekers, <strong>chlorogenic acid may also aid in fat loss</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16545124\">Studies</a> suggest that the antioxidant aids in the production of the hormone adiponectin, which is known for assisting in fat loss and preventing the storage of fat in the liver.</p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that Chlorogenic acid can only be obtained from <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/green-coffee-bean-extract-its-coffee-2-0-in-pill-form/\" target=\"_blank\">green coffee bean extract</a> in supplement form. Green coffee bean as a drink contains very little of the antioxidant due to most of the compound being destroyed when the beans are roasted.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"> Benefit #6: Fat Burners Increase Physical Output</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/IMG_6724-1024x690.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/IMG_6724-150x101.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/IMG_6724-300x202.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/IMG_6724-1024x690.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/IMG_6724.jpg 4351w\" alt=\"IMG_6724\" /></p>\n\n<p>To see results and break through plateaus, you have to train to the max with respects to both cardio and strength training.

One such herb is rhodiola rosea, which, like caffeine, has also been demonstrated in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15256690\">studies</a> to improve performance during exercise.</p>\n\n<p>If training short of failure was enough for achieving great results, then much more people would be sporting a six-pack.

Such as is the case with ginseng, found in many weight loss and energy products.</p>\n\n<p>Ginseng, as it turns out, is a known testosterone booster as proven in this <a href=\"http://iast.net/testosterone-booster-ingredients/ginseng-benefits-side-effects/\">study</a>.

Furthermore, this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25105998\">study</a> backs up the claims of testosterone as an essential component of weight loss.</p>\n\n<p>For women, the thoughts of elevated testosterone may be concerning since most prefer to lose fat while keeping muscle gain to a minimum.</p>\n\n<p>Really, there is no need to worry since females do not naturally produce testosterone at the rate men do.

Before heading to your nearest GNC, there’s a thing or two you need to know about weight loss supplements.\n\nToo many people have false notions about what such a product can and cannot do. When it comes to any performance-enhancing supplement, your expectations need to be realistic.\n\nWhen you truly understand the how, what, and why of fat burners, then you’ll be able to make a decision based on reason and not on hype that supplement makers shove down your throat.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">1. Supplement Labels Can Be Misleading</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_77665948_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x693.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_77665948_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x203.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_77665948_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x693.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_77665948_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5641w\" alt=\"Businessman reading a contract\" />\n\nSupplement labels are not regulated by the FDA, so manufacturers basically have free reign over what they put on the packaging. The results are claims that, while not outright lies, are often gross exaggerations.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Clinically Proven? By Whom?</strong>.</p><p>\nOne prime example and one that you often see on fat burners is the two words often written in bold lettering: “clinically proven.” A product that is clinically proven definitely sounds like the real deal. After all, it means that some form of laboratory studies were done to prove that the product works, doesn’t it?\n\nHere’s the thing: there is no official definition that constitutes the meaning of “clinically proven.” This means any company can claim their product is clinically proven as long as it performed some form of study.\n\nOften times, those studies consist of company-funded research that barely adhered to strict scientific protocol. The “study” typically includes having a small test sample try the product while also beginning a diet and workout regimen. Any results made would then be attributed to the supplement.\n\nYou want to make sure that a product that claims to be clinically proven was actually tested in an independent study and published in a scientific journal or periodical.\n\nA legitimate study would conduct the study using rigorous protocols, such as:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Double blind conditions</li>\n \t<li>Accounting for external factors, such as pre-existing health conditions, socio-economic status, or lifestyle of the test sample</li>\n \t<li>Using a large enough sample representative of the demographic the supplement is targeted towards to, such as gender, age range, and level of physical activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Do Your Own Research</strong>.</p><p>\nThe more claims a fat burner makes, the more research is needed on your end. Look up scientific journals to see if any of the ingredients actually do what is claimed on the label.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>With <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>, every ingredient has multiple independent studies under its belt.</strong>.</p><p>\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">Caffeine</a>, for example, has numerous studies performed at prestigious universities and medical centers that affirm the stimulants effective use for weight loss.\n\nHere’s one such study from <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/12032741\">Europe PubMed Central</a> and another from the scientific journal <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1467-789x.2001.00038.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false\">Obesity Reviews</a>.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">2.

You don’t want to develop a tolerance to any of the ingredients. When that happens, the body becomes accustomed to it and no longer responds to its effects.\n\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">Caffeine</a>, which is present in most weight loss products, is a compound most people eventually develop a tolerance for.\n\nThis is something most coffee drinkers can attest to. When they had their first cup of Joe, they likely felt a powerful energy kick. However, after taking it every day for months on end, they no longer feel the effects or would need to consume more to feel the effect.\n\nThe same goes for the rise of metabolism associated with caffeine use. Initially, your body will respond to the stimulant by raising body thermogenesis, thereby burning more calories.\n\nHowever, with prolonged use, your body will eventually compensate by reducing its natural metabolic rate. As a result, once you go off caffeine, your basal metabolic rate will likely be slower than it was before you got on the caffeine.\n\n<strong>Fat burners should be taken in rhythm with your fat loss plan</strong>. Fat loss phases are typically done in cycles, usually four to six weeks before being swapped out with a muscle building phase or an off phase.\n\nOnly take a fat burner during your fat loss phase. This applies to any fat burning product, even one that only uses all-natural ingredients like <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/tea-rexx/\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">3.

The increase, though, is usually only by about one degree and only occurs when metabolism rises following cardio exercise or strength training.\n\nWhile that may seem miniscule, the additional calories burned by that extra one degree rise in body temperature do add up.\n\nHOWEVER, if you fail to rein in your diet and allow yourself to have that donut or slice of cheesecake, then you completely cancelled out the additional calories that were burned.\n\nRemember, <strong>if the calories that went in are greater than the calories that went out, then you’re going to gain weight</strong>.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">4. Even Natural Fat Burners May Have Side Effects</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_91586838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_91586838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_91586838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_91586838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_91586838_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5512w\" alt=\"herbal medicinal in capsules\" />\n\nJust because a supplement is all-natural does not mean you can consume it like candy. Just about every natural ingredient, herb, or even food has side effects if taken in excess.\n\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">Caffeine</a> is natural, yet over consumption has been linked to sleeplessness, nervousness, irregular heartbeat, and the jitters.\n\nIt may be obvious, but it needs to be emphasized because there are always a minority few out there that has it in their heads that taking twice the dosage equals twice the results.\n\nNot only do you need to stick to the dosage, but it’s even advisable that you take roughly half the dosage when taking a fat burner for the first time.\n\nThis will help you evaluate whether you feel any uncomfortable side effects or adverse reactions. From there, you can gradually move up to the recommended dosage, but never go over.\n\nOn the subject of side effects, keep in mind that some of the ingredients found in fat burners are also found in everyday foods. If you consume coffee or tea, then the caffeine content from those beverages count towards the daily recommended dose.\n\n<strong> Be mindful that even too much of a good thing can be bad for you</strong>, which is why you should always keep a food log and record the foods you’re eating.\n\nAny supplements taken needs to be logged as well. If you experience any unusual sensations after taking a particular food or supplement, be sure to also keep tabs of that.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">5. Taking Below the Recommended Dosage</h3>\nAs mentioned, taking about half the recommended dose is usually recommended when taking a fat burner for the first time. If you see good results at half the dose, then by all means stick to that dose; otherwise, gradually move up to the dosage listed on the label.\n\nIn an effort to save money and make the bottle last as long as possible, some dieters continue to only use half the dose. This means usually taking only one capsule when the direction says to take two or three, or only taking one serving a day when directions recommend two or three servings daily.\n\nIf you’re a bigger guy or gal, it’s unlikely that a partial dose will be enough for the supplement to go into full effect.\n\nLook, supplements aren’t always cheap, and it’s understandable that you want to stretch your dollar as much as possible. <strong>However, if you’re not taking a supplement at a dose needed to produce physiological change, then you’re just throwing money down the drain.</strong>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">6.

There are simply too many factors that are at play when it comes to fat loss, including gender, age, genetics, current body mass index, current active lifestyle, and the way your body responds to certain ingredients.\n\nIt’s quite possible that you and a friend can follow the same diet, same workout routine, and take the same fat burner yet see different results.\n\nYou especially should not compare results to those before and after photos. This isn’t to say those photos are edited, but the ones typically seen in magazines and used for promoting a brand new supplement aren’t always what they appear to be.\n\nSome of those before and after pics, in fact, were even taken on the same day or just days apart. The after photo is simply taken under better lighting conditions and within minutes after a training session when the body has that pumped and vascular look.\n\nEveryone progresses at a different rate, so don’t ever compare your results to someone else’s, or else you’ll be vulnerable to setting yourself up for failure due to unreasonable expectations.\n\nRemember that <strong><a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Fat Burners</a> help by providing a slight metabolism boost and/or suppressing appetite</strong>; they cannot override your genetics or reverse your biological clock.\n\nIn any case, if you’re experiencing less than optimal results, then the key lies in modifying your diet and/or workout rather than switching fat burners.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">7. Fat Burners Are Absolutely Safe Provided You Follow Dosage Instructions</h3>\nFat burners have received somewhat of a negative reputation following the federal ban of ephedra in 2004. Up until that point, ephedrine was a major ingredient found in most big name fat loss supplements.\n\nEphedra became a highly discussed topic within the fitness community after several reported deaths associated with its use. In total, there were <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4721505/ns/health-alternative_medicine/t/nationwide-ban-ephedra-goes-effect/#.VoMqoxUrLIU\">155 reported deaths</a>, including the passing of Steve Bechler, pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles.\n\n<strong>What about modern fat burners?</strong> None of them contain ephedra, so are they safe for use? Weight loss supplements are no more harmful than a typical over-the-counter medicine or herbal remedy.\n\nThink of it this way: if you take an aspirin pill, it’ll relieve your headache; if you take half the bottle, it’ll probably kill you.\n\nIt all comes down to consuming the supplement responsibly. This means under no circumstances should you ever exceed dosage recommendations.\n\nAs far as the deaths associated with ephedra goes, remember that there are thousands of others who have taken the supplement with no incident. Those that died either took the supplement in excess or had preexisting health conditions that made taking the pills unsafe.\n\n<strong>Always read the label</strong>; it will list the conditions in which the product should not be taken, such as if you’re pregnant or under a certain age. This goes for all supplements including those containing natural ingredients.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">8.

This is definitely a huge plus especially since virtually every fat loss diet (or the legitimate ones at least) requires a calorie deficit.\n\nWhile taking a weight loss supplement certainly makes the process more manageable, you still need to exercise some degree of discipline and not put yourself in a situation where you may be tempted to break from your diet.\n\nThere’s often a misconception that taking an appetite suppressant means you will feel absolutely satiated all the time with zero cravings.\n\nWhile the food cravings may be lessened, you will still feel the urge to indulge... especially if you see all the delicious food before you at a buffet or smell the enticing aroma when passing by a Cinnabon.\n\nYou should still take active steps to remove yourself from being in such situations. This may include avoiding certain aisles at the supermarket or turning down invitations to dine out.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">9.

Before heading to your nearest GNC, there’s a thing or two you need to know about weight loss supplements.</p>\n\n<p>Too many people have false notions about what such a product can and cannot do. When it comes to any performance-enhancing supplement, your expectations need to be realistic.</p>\n\n<p>When you truly understand the how, what, and why of fat burners, then you’ll be able to make a decision based on reason and not on hype that supplement makers shove down your throat.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">1. Supplement Labels Can Be Misleading</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_77665948_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x693.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_77665948_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x203.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_77665948_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x693.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_77665948_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5641w\" alt=\"Businessman reading a contract\" /></p>\n\n<p>Supplement labels are not regulated by the FDA, so manufacturers basically have free reign over what they put on the packaging. The results are claims that, while not outright lies, are often gross exaggerations. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Clinically Proven? By Whom?</strong>.</p><p> <br />\nOne prime example and one that you often see on fat burners is the two words often written in bold lettering: “clinically proven.” A product that is clinically proven definitely sounds like the real deal. After all, it means that some form of laboratory studies were done to prove that the product works, doesn’t it?</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the thing: there is no official definition that constitutes the meaning of “clinically proven.” This means any company can claim their product is clinically proven as long as it performed some form of study.</p>\n\n<p>Often times, those studies consist of company-funded research that barely adhered to strict scientific protocol. The “study” typically includes having a small test sample try the product while also beginning a diet and workout regimen. Any results made would then be attributed to the supplement.</p>\n\n<p>You want to make sure that a product that claims to be clinically proven was actually tested in an independent study and published in a scientific journal or periodical.</p>\n\n<p>A legitimate study would conduct the study using rigorous protocols, such as:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n     <li>Double blind conditions</li>\n     <li>Accounting for external factors, such as pre-existing health conditions, socio-economic status, or lifestyle of the test sample</li>\n     <li>Using a large enough sample representative of the demographic the supplement is targeted towards to, such as gender, age range, and level of physical activity.</li>\n</ul>  \n\n<p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Do Your Own Research</strong>.</p><p> <br />\nThe more claims a fat burner makes, the more research is needed on your end. Look up scientific journals to see if any of the ingredients actually do what is claimed on the label. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>With <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>, every ingredient has multiple independent studies under its belt.</strong>.</p><p> <br />\n<a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">Caffeine</a>, for example, has numerous studies performed at prestigious universities and medical centers that affirm the stimulants effective use for weight loss.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s one such study from <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/12032741\">Europe PubMed Central</a> and another from the scientific journal <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1467-789x.2001.00038.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false\">Obesity Reviews</a>.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">2.

You don’t want to develop a tolerance to any of the ingredients. When that happens, the body becomes accustomed to it and no longer responds to its effects.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">Caffeine</a>, which is present in most weight loss products, is a compound most people eventually develop a tolerance for.</p>\n\n<p>This is something most coffee drinkers can attest to. When they had their first cup of Joe, they likely felt a powerful energy kick. However, after taking it every day for months on end, they no longer feel the effects or would need to consume more to feel the effect.</p>\n\n<p>The same goes for the rise of metabolism associated with caffeine use. Initially, your body will respond to the stimulant by raising body thermogenesis, thereby burning more calories.</p>\n\n<p>However, with prolonged use, your body will eventually compensate by reducing its natural metabolic rate. As a result, once you go off caffeine, your basal metabolic rate will likely be slower than it was before you got on the caffeine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fat burners should be taken in rhythm with your fat loss plan</strong>. Fat loss phases are typically done in cycles, usually four to six weeks before being swapped out with a muscle building phase or an off phase.</p>\n\n<p>Only take a fat burner during your fat loss phase. This applies to any fat burning product, even one that only uses all-natural ingredients like <a href=\"https://www.brolaboratories.com/product/tea-rexx/\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">3.

The increase, though, is usually only by about one degree and only occurs when metabolism rises following cardio exercise or strength training.</p>\n\n<p>While that may seem miniscule, the additional calories burned by that extra one degree rise in body temperature do add up.</p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, if you fail to rein in your diet and allow yourself to have that donut or slice of cheesecake, then you completely cancelled out the additional calories that were burned.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, <strong>if the calories that went in are greater than the calories that went out, then you’re going to gain weight</strong>.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">4.

However, there are some misconceptions about what BCAAs are and what they can and can't do. This post covers some common mistakes when using a BCAA supplement.</h3>\nBranched chain amino acids (<a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">BCAAs</a>) have long been a vital supplement for athletes trying to retain as much muscle mass as possible when trying to lose fat.\n\nThey’re especially a great addition to your supplementation during periods of intermittent fasting or when on a drastic calorie deficit.\n\nHowever, for BCAAs to be effective, they have to be taken the right way. There are some misconceptions about what BCAAS are and some confusion over what they can and cannot do.\n\nThese misunderstandings lead to improper use of the supplement which could be compromising their effectiveness.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #1: Reducing Protein Intake</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05105015/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-5-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05105015/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-5-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05105015/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-5-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05105015/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05105015/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-5.jpg 5562w\" alt=\"assorted raw meats\" />\n\nThere’s a false belief that taking BCAAs is somehow an excuse for reducing the intake of protein.\n\nWhile BCAAs contain three essential amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), protein from a source like meat, dairy, or whey have a much more complete amino acid profile, usually containing most or all the 20 amino acids that make up the protein molecule.\n\nAs such, you need to maintain a high protein intake whether you’re in a muscle building or fat loss phase. Taking a BCAA supplement by no means is a reason for you to take your foot off the pedal with respects to consumption of this vital macronutrient.\n\nRemember that of the 20 amino acids, nine are essential, <strong>meaning that they need to be acquired through food or supplementation since they cannot be produced naturally by the body</strong>. BCAAs make up three of these essential aminos. By cutting down on your protein intake, you risk depriving your body of the remaining six.\n\nFurthermore, your protein intake should also come from a variety of sources, such as whey, meat, fish, and dairy, since all contain the essential aminos in varying ratios.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #2: Dropping BCAAs in Favor of Leucine Alone</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05110414/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05110414/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05110414/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05110414/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05110414/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone.jpg 4245w\" alt=\"sport, fitness, healthy lifestyle and people concept - close up of man with jar and bottle preparing protein shake\" />\n\nSome supplement manufacturers are also releasing supplements that contain the sole amino acid leucine. <strong>This specific amino acid, after all, is believed to play the most important role in protein synthesis.</strong>\n\nResearch shows that leucine is essential for activating the crucial protein kinase known as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates muscle cell growth and motility.\n\nLeucine is without a doubt one of the most important, if not the most important, essential amino acid; its role in muscle growth is undeniable. However, this is no reason to take the amino acid by itself in place of a BCAA supplement.\n\nIsoleucine and valine, while perhaps not as beneficial in comparison, still play useful roles.\n\nDuring intense physical activity, isoleucine is broken down for energy within the muscle tissue to keep the body going. It also helps regulate blood sugar and improves the muscle’s ability to use glucose.\n\nDeficiency in this amino acid has been linked to symptoms that include fatigue, brain fog, migraines, dizziness, and depression.\n\nLikewise, valine also has an integral function and is needed by the body for removing excess nitrogen from the liver and transporting it to other areas of the body where needed.\n\nValine is also necessary for healthy cognitive functioning and stimulating the central nervous system.\n\nAs you can see, while leucine is often regarded as the star between the three branched chain amino acids, all are important. One should not be taken to the exclusion of the other two.\n\nA good BCAA, however, should contain the three amino acids in the right ratios. <strong>A ratio of about 2:1:1 for leucine, valine, and isoleucine respectively sounds just about right.</strong>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #3: Using a BCAA That Incorporates a Proprietary Blend</h3>\nThese days, it’s not unusual for BCAA supplements to contain additional ingredients. For the most part, there is nothing wrong with this as long as the extra ingredients are also scientifically proven.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\">Revolt</a>, for example, also contains a serving of caffeine, so it also delivers a surge of energy when taken before a workout.</strong>.</p><p>\nThis is absolutely fine and even beneficial as it gives you a 2-in-1 benefit type of deal. With that being said, though, you should be wary of Manufacturers that claim their BCAA supplement is superior due to using a “secretly guarded” proprietary blend. Further claims may include the promise of superior delivery and absorption by your muscle cells.\n\nYou should naturally be cautious if the BCAA is incorporated into these blends, <strong>especially since the ratios and amount of the amino acids aren’t disclosed.</strong>\n\nThe proprietary blend is also often an excuse to ramp up the price. It’s also an excuse for the company to release more products with new and “improved” blends that are supposedly even better and revolutionary than the previous product.\n\nWhen it comes to BCAAs, simple really is better. While the addition of an ingredient or two is fine, you really don’t need anything else besides the BCAAs themselves.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #4: Not Taking BCAAs at the Right Time</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111014/The-10-Commandments-of-Maintaining-Testosterone-Levels-While-Dieting-8-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111014/The-10-Commandments-of-Maintaining-Testosterone-Levels-While-Dieting-8-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111014/The-10-Commandments-of-Maintaining-Testosterone-Levels-While-Dieting-8-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111014/The-10-Commandments-of-Maintaining-Testosterone-Levels-While-Dieting-8-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111014/The-10-Commandments-of-Maintaining-Testosterone-Levels-While-Dieting-8.jpg 4752w\" alt=\"Old Style Photo. Silver Stopwatch on the table\" />\n\nMost supplements should be taken during certain times of the day. <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">Creatine monohydrate</a>, for example, is usually taken as part of a pre-workout formula due to its ability to improve energy output.\n\nThe same goes for BCAAs. <strong>Ideally, the supplement should be taken either before or after a workout, or even both before and after.</strong>\n\nSome people make the mistake of taking it at a random time of the day, usually hours before or after their workout and expect to reap the same benefit; unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way.\n\n<strong>BCAAs are so beneficial because they prevent muscle catabolism by promoting protein synthesis.</strong> This helps the body preserve the muscle mass that would otherwise be lost due to a calorie deficit diet or training on an empty stomach to accelerate fat loss. The latter is precisely why BCAAs need to be taken before exercising.\n\nBCAAs provide the muscle with energy; otherwise the muscles will be depleted and give out on you during a strenuous workout since it’s essentially running on a near-empty gas tank.\n\nBCAAs can also be taken after a workout to facilitate in the recovery process and replenish energy stores.  This <a href=\"http://www.jissn.com/content/9/1/20\">study</a> published under the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition verifies the role of BCAAs in reducing exercise-induced muscle damage.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #5: Taking a Whey Protein With a High BCAA Content</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111508/Fotolia_79808551_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111508/Fotolia_79808551_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111508/Fotolia_79808551_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111508/Fotolia_79808551_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111508/Fotolia_79808551_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 7360w\" alt=\"Whey protein scoupe. Sports nutrition.\" />\n\nMost whey protein supplements have their own amino acid profile. The same goes for other protein supplements consisting of casein, egg or soy.\n\nMost protein powders already contain a comprehensive serving of BCAAs. However, this does not mean you should automatically forgo a BCAA supplement.\n\nThe problem with the BCAAs in whey and other protein products is that they’re bonded to other amino acids. BCAAs are most effective when isolated from the other amino acids. When linked as part of a bigger amino acid chain, it takes several hours for the BCAAs to be “liberated” and absorbed into the bloodstream and into the muscles.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">BCAA supplements</a>, on the other hand, are free-form.

Taking a BCAA supplement by no means is a reason for you to take your foot off the pedal with respects to consumption of this vital macronutrient.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that of the 20 amino acids, nine are essential, <strong>meaning that they need to be acquired through food or supplementation since they cannot be produced naturally by the body</strong>. BCAAs make up three of these essential aminos. By cutting down on your protein intake, you risk depriving your body of the remaining six.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, your protein intake should also come from a variety of sources, such as whey, meat, fish, and dairy, since all contain the essential aminos in varying ratios.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #2: Dropping BCAAs in Favor of Leucine Alone</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05110414/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05110414/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05110414/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05110414/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05110414/Creatine-Inexpensive-Supplement-to-Boost-Testosterone.jpg 4245w\" alt=\"sport, fitness, healthy lifestyle and people concept - close up of man with jar and bottle preparing protein shake\" /></p>\n\n<p>Some supplement manufacturers are also releasing supplements that contain the sole amino acid leucine. <strong>This specific amino acid, after all, is believed to play the most important role in protein synthesis.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Research shows that leucine is essential for activating the crucial protein kinase known as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates muscle cell growth and motility.</p>\n\n<p>Leucine is without a doubt one of the most important, if not the most important, essential amino acid; its role in muscle growth is undeniable. However, this is no reason to take the amino acid by itself in place of a BCAA supplement.</p>\n\n<p>Isoleucine and valine, while perhaps not as beneficial in comparison, still play useful roles.</p>\n\n<p>During intense physical activity, isoleucine is broken down for energy within the muscle tissue to keep the body going. It also helps regulate blood sugar and improves the muscle’s ability to use glucose.</p>\n\n<p>Deficiency in this amino acid has been linked to symptoms that include fatigue, brain fog, migraines, dizziness, and depression.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, valine also has an integral function and is needed by the body for removing excess nitrogen from the liver and transporting it to other areas of the body where needed.</p>\n\n<p>Valine is also necessary for healthy cognitive functioning and stimulating the central nervous system.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, while leucine is often regarded as the star between the three branched chain amino acids, all are important. One should not be taken to the exclusion of the other two.</p>\n\n<p>A good BCAA, however, should contain the three amino acids in the right ratios. <strong>A ratio of about 2:1:1 for leucine, valine, and isoleucine respectively sounds just about right.</strong>  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #3: Using a BCAA That Incorporates a Proprietary Blend</h3>  \n\n<p>These days, it’s not unusual for BCAA supplements to contain additional ingredients. For the most part, there is nothing wrong with this as long as the extra ingredients are also scientifically proven. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\">Revolt</a>, for example, also contains a serving of caffeine, so it also delivers a surge of energy when taken before a workout.</strong>.</p><p> <br />\nThis is absolutely fine and even beneficial as it gives you a 2-in-1 benefit type of deal. With that being said, though, you should be wary of Manufacturers that claim their BCAA supplement is superior due to using a “secretly guarded” proprietary blend. Further claims may include the promise of superior delivery and absorption by your muscle cells.</p>\n\n<p>You should naturally be cautious if the BCAA is incorporated into these blends, <strong>especially since the ratios and amount of the amino acids aren’t disclosed.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The proprietary blend is also often an excuse to ramp up the price. It’s also an excuse for the company to release more products with new and “improved” blends that are supposedly even better and revolutionary than the previous product.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to BCAAs, simple really is better. While the addition of an ingredient or two is fine, you really don’t need anything else besides the BCAAs themselves.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistake #4: Not Taking BCAAs at the Right Time</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111014/The-10-Commandments-of-Maintaining-Testosterone-Levels-While-Dieting-8-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111014/The-10-Commandments-of-Maintaining-Testosterone-Levels-While-Dieting-8-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111014/The-10-Commandments-of-Maintaining-Testosterone-Levels-While-Dieting-8-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111014/The-10-Commandments-of-Maintaining-Testosterone-Levels-While-Dieting-8-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05111014/The-10-Commandments-of-Maintaining-Testosterone-Levels-While-Dieting-8.jpg 4752w\" alt=\"Old Style Photo.

Here are some of the major benefits of using a BCAA Supplement.</h3>\nDo you really need a BCAA supplement? Well, it depends on your specific goal. If your aim is maximum fat loss while preserving muscle mass, then BCAAs can be a powerful weapon if combined with the right dieting and training principles.\n\nIf you take supplements at all, then a good BCAA product should make up part of the foundation of your supplementation; it will do your body good in more ways than one.\n\nDespite being such an integral product, very few people take BCAAs simply because they don’t know what it does and haven’t taken the time to read what the scientific literature has to say about it.\n\nThis post will get straight to the point about BCAAs and their benefits.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #1: BCAAs Help You Preserve Muscle</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/thumb_IMG_7439_1024.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/thumb_IMG_7439_1024-150x95.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/thumb_IMG_7439_1024-300x190.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/thumb_IMG_7439_1024.jpg 851w\" alt=\"thumb_IMG_7439_1024\" />\n\nHelping you preserve muscle mass is what BCAAs are all about. This is especially the case when on a fat loss phase.\n\nWhen you cut calories to lose fat, a bit of muscle mass will inevitably take a hit as well.\n\nWhile the way you exercise can determine the ratio of fat to muscle mass burned, there is no method of training that completely burns 100% fat while leaving your muscles 100% unscathed.\n\nThis is where BCAAs enter the picture. The three essential amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) are needed for protein synthesis.\n\nScientific explanation aside, all you need to know about protein synthesis is that it plays a pivotal role in the building and repair of muscle cells.\n\nWhen you train on a calorie deficit, amino acids in the muscles are broken down and used for fuel. The net effect is catabolism, or the breakdown of the muscles you pushed yourself so hard in the gym to earn.\n\nBCAAs improve protein synthesis while reducing the rate of muscle breakdown. Put another way, calorie deficits and fasted training lowers protein synthesis while increasing muscle breakdown.\n\n<strong>BCAAs help reduce the difference so that the rate of protein synthesis and muscle breakdown are on a more equal footing.</strong>\n\nThis is made possible through the presence of hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB), which is produced when leucine is metabolized. <strong>HMB is believed to inhibit the breakdown of protein into amino acids</strong>, which occurs when the body attempts to target the muscle for usable energy.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #2: BCAAs Help You Lose Fat (but It’s not a Fat Burner)</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_89167346_Subscription_Monthly_L-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_89167346_Subscription_Monthly_L-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_89167346_Subscription_Monthly_L-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_89167346_Subscription_Monthly_L-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_89167346_Subscription_Monthly_L.jpg 3100w\" alt=\"Fat Man is measuring his belly.\" />\n\nJust to be clear, BCAAs are not a fat loss supplement and should not be taken as such. You’re not going to get a metabolism spike out of it, or not directly at least.\n\nWith that being said, though, BCAAs just might help you lose the extra pounds and keep it off.\n\nHow does it do this? As mentioned, <strong>BCAAs help you retain muscle</strong>. That additional muscle, in turn, burns additional calories on a daily basis. In this way, BCAA does help raise body thermogenesis indirectly.\n\nBCAAs also act as an appetite suppressant, though again in an indirect manner. Most people are familiar with the harmful effects of too much cortisol production. Cortisol in excess encourages the body to hold onto its fat stores. It’s also linked too increased appetite.\n\nWell, BCAAs are believed to reduce cortisol, thus preventing the weight gain ultimately associated with the hormone.\n\nWhile the revelations of BCAAs having some fat loss benefits are a definite plus, don’t go taking the supplement thinking that it’s going to drastically burn a ton of calories off your body.\n\nRemember, the effects work more indirectly; you should still take a fat burner like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a> if weight loss is your primary aim.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #3: BCAAs Help Reduce Muscle Soreness</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_76799759_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x682.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_76799759_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_76799759_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_76799759_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x682.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_76799759_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 4928w\" alt=\"Male suffering pain on his chest muscle\" />\n\nIf you’re training to muscle failure, which you should be doing regardless if you’re trying to build muscle or lose fat, then you can expect your body to feel absolutely beat the next day or two after the workout.\n\nIf you’re training frequently and alternating between strength training and cardio, then a sore body can hamper your performance in either or both types of workouts. <strong>A diminished performance equals diminished results.</strong>\n\nBCAAs have been shown to combat the effects of achy muscles. This was proven in a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20087302\">Japanese study</a> where subjects administered BCAA reported less soreness over a placebo group. This is believed to be attributed to less inflammation and a faster recovery period.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #4: BCAAs Increase Workout Performance</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_65860174_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x680.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_65860174_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x199.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_65860174_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x680.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_65860174_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg 4147w\" alt=\"Strong body woman workout\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Do you know what really makes muscle grow? It’s getting in that 11<sup>th</sup> rep when using a weight that’s supposed to be your 10-rep max..</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In other words, muscle grows when you push yourself harder than before..</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The same goes for fat loss.

Will power alone won’t always get you there.\n\nThis is another area where BCAAs may help. This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16424144\">study</a> demonstrated the efficacy of BCAAs for offsetting muscle fatigue during strenuous exercise.\n\nFor endurance athletes who are more concerned about performance than body composition, they may benefit from BCAAs as well.\n\nOne <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20733521\">study</a> demonstrated the positive effects BCAA supplementation had on endurance cyclists. This is certainly food for thought for all athletes whether they compete recreationally or professionally.\n\nRegardless of how you train, you want to be zoned in physically and mentally. A product like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">Revolt</a> was created with this in mind.\n\nAside from the BCAAs, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> is also included, which has also been shown to enhance physical performance. In this sense, you get a double whammy effect that enhances your performance better than taking either BCAA or caffeine alone.\n<h3> Benefit #5: BCAAs Increase Testosterone</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/IMG_0975-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/IMG_0975-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/IMG_0975-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/IMG_0975-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/IMG_0975.jpg 5184w\" alt=\"IMG_0975\" />\n\nMuscle gains ultimately come down to testosterone. If you’re not producing enough, then your muscles aren’t going to get bigger; it’s that simple. This is another area where BCAAs may be useful.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9239992\">study</a> shows that BCAAs, or leucine more specifically, has been linked to higher testosterone production among test subjects. The same study also showed that subjects had lower cortisol levels. Excess cortisol, of course, increases fat stores. Too much cortisol also reduces free testosterone.\n\nIt is common knowledge that testosterone increases during workout. The testosterone surge, though, is temporary and eventually returns to baseline levels after exercise.\n\nSupplementing with BCAAs have been shown to keep T levels elevated for up several hours after leaving the gym. A sustained testosterone release plays a key role in protein synthesis long after the workout has ended.\n\nIt should also be noted that a calorie deficit diet has also been linked to lower testosterone. When you consume less food, the body uses the limited nutrients for bodily functions necessary for survival.\n\nEverything else, including the production of anabolic hormones, is considered nonessential and practically takes a back seat. BCAA supplementation may be able to offset some of these negative impacts of a low calorie diet.\n\nOn a related note, BCAAs are also recommended for older men suffering from age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia).\n\nIt’s an unfortunate fact that testosterone naturally decreases with age. This inevitably leads to decreased strength and muscle dystrophy. Doctors may recommend testosterone replacement therapy for men with sarcopenia to counteract the effects of muscle loss. However, repeated TRT use is known to diminish the body’s natural ability to produce testosterone naturally.\n\nPerforming strength training, consuming a high protein diet, and supplementing with BCAAs are a more natural solution for keeping age-related muscle loss at bay.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #6: BCAAs Play an Important Role with Cholesterol</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_81970052_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_81970052_Subscription_Monthly_XL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_81970052_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_81970052_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_81970052_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg 3600w\" alt=\"Cholesterol plaque in artery\" />\n\nMost people are aware of the difference between HDL (good) and LDL (bad) cholesterol. Even so, the word “cholesterol” has always had a negative connotation. Nevertheless, BCAAs may have a positive impact on HDL cholesterol, as proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ergo-log.com/bcaas-improve-cholesterol-balance-says-animal-study.html\">study</a>.\n\nBCAAs’ role on good cholesterol is actually quite important in the bigger scheme of things. <strong>HDL cholesterol is linked to higher testosterone.</strong> It’s also linked to heart disease prevention, not to mention it lowers high blood pressure.\n\nYou know what food is associated with higher HDL levels? Eggs! That’s right, the food that has unfairly been demonized for its high cholesterol content is actually linked to higher good cholesterol levels. <strong>Eggs just also happen to be one of the best sources of BCAAs</strong>.\n\nWhat about LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol? Well, as it turns out, <strong>leucine has been demonstrated to decrease LDL by 27%</strong> as shown in a <a href=\"http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/56/6/1647.full\">study</a> published under the American Diabetes Association.\n\nHigh LDL levels are associated with increased risk of pulmonary disease.

Here are some of the major benefits of using a BCAA Supplement.</h3>  \n\n<p>Do you really need a BCAA supplement? Well, it depends on your specific goal. If your aim is maximum fat loss while preserving muscle mass, then BCAAs can be a powerful weapon if combined with the right dieting and training principles.</p>\n\n<p>If you take supplements at all, then a good BCAA product should make up part of the foundation of your supplementation; it will do your body good in more ways than one.</p>\n\n<p>Despite being such an integral product, very few people take BCAAs simply because they don’t know what it does and haven’t taken the time to read what the scientific literature has to say about it.</p>\n\n<p>This post will get straight to the point about BCAAs and their benefits.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #1: BCAAs Help You Preserve Muscle</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/thumb_IMG_7439_1024.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/thumb_IMG_7439_1024-150x95.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/thumb_IMG_7439_1024-300x190.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/thumb_IMG_7439_1024.jpg 851w\" alt=\"thumb_IMG_7439_1024\" /></p>\n\n<p>Helping you preserve muscle mass is what BCAAs are all about. This is especially the case when on a fat loss phase.</p>\n\n<p>When you cut calories to lose fat, a bit of muscle mass will inevitably take a hit as well.</p>\n\n<p>While the way you exercise can determine the ratio of fat to muscle mass burned, there is no method of training that completely burns 100% fat while leaving your muscles 100% unscathed.</p>\n\n<p>This is where BCAAs enter the picture. The three essential amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) are needed for protein synthesis.</p>\n\n<p>Scientific explanation aside, all you need to know about protein synthesis is that it plays a pivotal role in the building and repair of muscle cells.</p>\n\n<p>When you train on a calorie deficit, amino acids in the muscles are broken down and used for fuel. The net effect is catabolism, or the breakdown of the muscles you pushed yourself so hard in the gym to earn.</p>\n\n<p>BCAAs improve protein synthesis while reducing the rate of muscle breakdown. Put another way, calorie deficits and fasted training lowers protein synthesis while increasing muscle breakdown.</p>\n\n<p><strong>BCAAs help reduce the difference so that the rate of protein synthesis and muscle breakdown are on a more equal footing.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is made possible through the presence of hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB), which is produced when leucine is metabolized. <strong>HMB is believed to inhibit the breakdown of protein into amino acids</strong>, which occurs when the body attempts to target the muscle for usable energy.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #2: BCAAs Help You Lose Fat (but It’s not a Fat Burner)</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_89167346_Subscription_Monthly_L-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_89167346_Subscription_Monthly_L-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_89167346_Subscription_Monthly_L-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_89167346_Subscription_Monthly_L-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_89167346_Subscription_Monthly_L.jpg 3100w\" alt=\"Fat Man is measuring his belly.\" /></p>\n\n<p>Just to be clear, BCAAs are not a fat loss supplement and should not be taken as such. You’re not going to get a metabolism spike out of it, or not directly at least.</p>\n\n<p>With that being said, though, BCAAs just might help you lose the extra pounds and keep it off.</p>\n\n<p>How does it do this? As mentioned, <strong>BCAAs help you retain muscle</strong>. That additional muscle, in turn, burns additional calories on a daily basis. In this way, BCAA does help raise body thermogenesis indirectly.</p>\n\n<p>BCAAs also act as an appetite suppressant, though again in an indirect manner. Most people are familiar with the harmful effects of too much cortisol production. Cortisol in excess encourages the body to hold onto its fat stores. It’s also linked too increased appetite.</p>\n\n<p>Well, BCAAs are believed to reduce cortisol, thus preventing the weight gain ultimately associated with the hormone.</p>\n\n<p>While the revelations of BCAAs having some fat loss benefits are a definite plus, don’t go taking the supplement thinking that it’s going to drastically burn a ton of calories off your body.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, the effects work more indirectly; you should still take a fat burner like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a> if weight loss is your primary aim.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #3: BCAAs Help Reduce Muscle Soreness</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_76799759_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x682.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_76799759_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_76799759_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_76799759_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x682.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_76799759_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 4928w\" alt=\"Male suffering pain on his chest muscle\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you’re training to muscle failure, which you should be doing regardless if you’re trying to build muscle or lose fat, then you can expect your body to feel absolutely beat the next day or two after the workout.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re training frequently and alternating between strength training and cardio, then a sore body can hamper your performance in either or both types of workouts. <strong>A diminished performance equals diminished results.</strong></p>\n\n<p>BCAAs have been shown to combat the effects of achy muscles. This was proven in a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20087302\">Japanese study</a> where subjects administered BCAA reported less soreness over a placebo group. This is believed to be attributed to less inflammation and a faster recovery period.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #4: BCAAs Increase Workout Performance</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_65860174_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x680.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_65860174_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x199.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_65860174_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x680.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_65860174_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg 4147w\" alt=\"Strong body woman workout\" /> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Do you know what really makes muscle grow? It’s getting in that 11<sup>th</sup> rep when using a weight that’s supposed to be your 10-rep max..</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In other words, muscle grows when you push yourself harder than before..</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The same goes for fat loss. Your metabolism is raised through the roof if you can perform 15-20 minutes of cardio done close to the threshold of your physical limit..</p><p> <br />\nOf course, getting in that final rep or additional 10-seconds of cardio when you’re absolutely depleted is easier said than done. Will power alone won’t always get you there.</p>\n\n<p>This is another area where BCAAs may help. This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16424144\">study</a> demonstrated the efficacy of BCAAs for offsetting muscle fatigue during strenuous exercise.</p>\n\n<p>For endurance athletes who are more concerned about performance than body composition, they may benefit from BCAAs as well.</p>\n\n<p>One <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20733521\">study</a> demonstrated the positive effects BCAA supplementation had on endurance cyclists. This is certainly food for thought for all athletes whether they compete recreationally or professionally.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of how you train, you want to be zoned in physically and mentally. A product like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">Revolt</a> was created with this in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the BCAAs, <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> is also included, which has also been shown to enhance physical performance. In this sense, you get a double whammy effect that enhances your performance better than taking either BCAA or caffeine alone.  </p>\n\n<h3> Benefit #5: BCAAs Increase Testosterone</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/IMG_0975-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/IMG_0975-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/IMG_0975-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/IMG_0975-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/IMG_0975.jpg 5184w\" alt=\"IMG_0975\" /></p>\n\n<p>Muscle gains ultimately come down to testosterone. If you’re not producing enough, then your muscles aren’t going to get bigger; it’s that simple. This is another area where BCAAs may be useful.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9239992\">study</a> shows that BCAAs, or leucine more specifically, has been linked to higher testosterone production among test subjects. The same study also showed that subjects had lower cortisol levels. Excess cortisol, of course, increases fat stores. Too much cortisol also reduces free testosterone.</p>\n\n<p>It is common knowledge that testosterone increases during workout. The testosterone surge, though, is temporary and eventually returns to baseline levels after exercise.</p>\n\n<p>Supplementing with BCAAs have been shown to keep T levels elevated for up several hours after leaving the gym. A sustained testosterone release plays a key role in protein synthesis long after the workout has ended.</p>\n\n<p>It should also be noted that a calorie deficit diet has also been linked to lower testosterone. When you consume less food, the body uses the limited nutrients for bodily functions necessary for survival.</p>\n\n<p>Everything else, including the production of anabolic hormones, is considered nonessential and practically takes a back seat. BCAA supplementation may be able to offset some of these negative impacts of a low calorie diet.</p>\n\n<p>On a related note, BCAAs are also recommended for older men suffering from age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia).</p>\n\n<p>It’s an unfortunate fact that testosterone naturally decreases with age. This inevitably leads to decreased strength and muscle dystrophy. Doctors may recommend testosterone replacement therapy for men with sarcopenia to counteract the effects of muscle loss. However, repeated TRT use is known to diminish the body’s natural ability to produce testosterone naturally.</p>\n\n<p>Performing strength training, consuming a high protein diet, and supplementing with BCAAs are a more natural solution for keeping age-related muscle loss at bay.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #6: BCAAs Play an Important Role with Cholesterol</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_81970052_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_81970052_Subscription_Monthly_XL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_81970052_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_81970052_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13110057/Fotolia_81970052_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg 3600w\" alt=\"Cholesterol plaque in artery\" /></p>\n\n<p>Most people are aware of the difference between HDL (good) and LDL (bad) cholesterol. Even so, the word “cholesterol” has always had a negative connotation. Nevertheless, BCAAs may have a positive impact on HDL cholesterol, as proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ergo-log.com/bcaas-improve-cholesterol-balance-says-animal-study.html\">study</a>.</p>\n\n<p>BCAAs’ role on good cholesterol is actually quite important in the bigger scheme of things. <strong>HDL cholesterol is linked to higher testosterone.</strong> It’s also linked to heart disease prevention, not to mention it lowers high blood pressure.</p>\n\n<p>You know what food is associated with higher HDL levels? Eggs! That’s right, the food that has unfairly been demonized for its high cholesterol content is actually linked to higher good cholesterol levels. <strong>Eggs just also happen to be one of the best sources of BCAAs</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>What about LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol? Well, as it turns out, <strong>leucine has been demonstrated to decrease LDL by 27%</strong> as shown in a <a href=\"http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/56/6/1647.full\">study</a> published under the American Diabetes Association.</p>\n\n<p>High LDL levels are associated with increased risk of pulmonary disease. It’s important that you maintain a healthy lifestyle to keep LDL cholesterol low even if you don’t particularly care much for acquiring rock-hard abs.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Benefit #8: BCAAs Promote a Positive Nitrogen Balance</h3>  \n\n<p>If you read bodybuilding magazines, then you may be familiar with the term “positive nitrogen balance.”</p>\n\n<p>One way protein differs from carbohydrates and fat is the addition of a nitrogen molecule in its molecular structure.

This is mostly due to lack of knowledge and misinformation.\n\nThis is really unfortunate because BCAAs rank up there among other proven supplements like whey and <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">creatine</a>.\n\nIf used the right way and for its intended purpose, this can prove to be a valuable item in your quest for achieving your dream physique.\n\nBy the time you reach the end of this post, you will have all the knowledge you need regarding BCAAs.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Are They?</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56713260_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x774.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56713260_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x227.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56713260_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x774.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56713260_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg 3734w\" alt=\"young girl looking chalkboard with interrogation symbol\" />\n\nBranched chain amino acids, or BCAAs as they’re often called, are three very important amino acids. This includes <strong>leucine</strong>, <strong>isoleucine</strong>, and <strong>valine</strong>.\n\nThese three are among the nine amino acids that are considered essential. By essential, this means they need to be acquired through food or supplementation since your body does not produce them as is the case with non-essential amino acids (comprising of 11 of the 20 AAs).\n\nOf course, this raises the question of what are amino acids. Simply put, <strong>they are the building blocks that make up the protein molecule, which in turn is what the muscles are made up of</strong>.\n\nThis is why a high-protein diet is recommended in just about every bodybuilding circle. Certain proteins, such as those found in meat and dairy, are especially high in BCAAs and other essential amino acids.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Makes BCAAs so Special Over the Other Amino Acids?</h3>\nSo why do BCAAs deserve special attention over the remaining 17 amino acids?\n\nWell, all amino acids are important, <strong>but some serve more beneficial functions than others</strong>, especially with respects to muscle retention and gains.\n\nBCAAs happen to be at the forefront when it comes to lean muscle development.\n\nFor starters, roughly a third of your muscles comprise of BCAAs. Also, unlike other amino acids, which are transported to the liver after being digested, BCAAs are shuttled straight to the muscles where they are used by muscle fibers for aiding in tissue repair and rebuilding.\n\nBCAAs also play a vital role in protein synthesis and keeping the body in a positive nitrogen balance, <strong>both of which are pivotal for muscle repair and recovery following a grueling workout</strong>. This equals muscle growth activation, or at the very least, muscle retention.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Who Should Take BCAAs?</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_89957529_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x546.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_89957529_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x80.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_89957529_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x160.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_89957529_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x546.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_89957529_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 7500w\" alt=\"Bodybuilding. Strong man and a woman posing on a dark background\" />\n\nThere are a lot of discussions regarding the necessity of BCAAs. Since they’re available in most foods and whey powders, why are they necessary at all?\n\nNot everyone needs to supplement with BCAAs. <strong>They’re primarily recommended for people trying to lose fat while holding onto every bit of muscle</strong>.\n\nIt’s common knowledge that fat loss is accompanied by some muscle loss due to the calorie deficit. Taking a serving of BCAAs about 30 minutes prior to exercise provides the body with the three essential aminos needed to keep the body in a state of protein synthesis.\n\nThis is crucial because when you work out on an empty stomach (<em>which I recommend you should be doing when training for fat loss</em>), your body is going to break down the protein in your muscles for energy. BCAAs can help reduce the rate of protein breakdown.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Why Not Just Eat More Protein?</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56772274_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x682.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56772274_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56772274_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56772274_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x682.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56772274_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 4928w\" alt=\"Hungry man can not wait till meat is cooked\" />\n\nSince protein from sources like red meat and whey contain BCAAs, why not just consume protein before working out?\n\nThere are two reasons this is not optimal...\n\n<strong>First</strong>, if you consume protein, which contains calories, then you are no longer training on an empty stomach.\n\nBCAA supplements aren’t completely calorie-free, but the amount is negligible, usually around 10 or 20 calories per serving. If you have calories in your system when training, then the body is going to turn to them for fuel instead of targeting your fat stores.\n\n<strong>Second</strong>, BCAAs in supplement form are far more bioavailable than the ones from food or protein powder. In the latter, the BCAAs are bonded to other amino acids and require a lengthy breakdown process in the digestive system.\n\nBCAA supplements contain just the three essential amino acids and are rapidly absorbed without undergoing a drawn out digestion process.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">It's All About Timing</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_83050618_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x600.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_83050618_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x88.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_83050618_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x176.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_83050618_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x600.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_83050618_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5184w\" alt=\"Time passing. Blue hourglass.\" />\n\nBCAAs aren’t a supplement that you take at your earliest convenience. <strong>The best time is to take the supplement is about half an hour before starting your workout</strong>.\n\nTaking an additional serving immediately after workout is also a good idea since studies show that BCAAs help alleviate muscle soreness.\n\nThe serving taken before workout, aside from preventing muscle catabolism, also increases energy output to help you train to your limit. Some BCAA products, such as <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">Revolt</a>, also contain <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> or other similar ingredients for an even more pronounced energy surge.\n\nAside from taking a serving before and after, you can even take it right in the middle of a workout. This is only recommended if the workout exceeds one hour.\n\nTraining, though, shouldn’t normally exceed 60 minutes. The only exception to this rule is if you perform cardio immediately following strength training, or if you’re training for endurance and performance rather than transforming your body.\n\nSome people may think that a dosage before, during, and after workout is a bit of an overkill. However, if you are training with full intensity, then your body will be needing all the nutrients and amino acids it can get.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">To Cycle or Not to Cycle?</h3>\nThere is also the question of cycling BCAAs. Remember, BCAAs are just amino acids; just as you don’t need to cycle whey protein intake, it’s not necessary to cycle BCAAs.\n\nThe supplement, after all, does contain a <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/8-benefits-of-using-a-bcaa-supplement/\" target=\"_blank\">multitude of benefits</a> that may prove to be helpful if taken continuously. However, if you do choose to cycle the supplement, take it when you begin your fat loss phase and go off it when on a muscle building plan.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">BCAA on Rest Days</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_92402846_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_92402846_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_92402846_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_92402846_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_92402846_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5616w\" alt=\"Young man relaxing on couch, teen pensive boy laying lazy on bed blue background\" />\n\nThere is also the question of whether you should take BCAAs every day or only on your workout days. There really is no right or wrong answer here. Taking them every day certainly won’t hurt.\n\nHere’s a good rule to follow: if you’re in a fat loss phase, then take a serving before and after workout on training days.\n\nAs far as your rest days are concerned, take a serving first thing in the morning if you’re fasting or consuming fewer calories than normal.\n\nThe addition of the BCAAs in your system after bed rise helps with muscle repair and is especially helpful given that your body just underwent an eight hour fast and is depleted of glycogen.\n\nThat’s assuming, of course, that you’re getting eight hours of sleep, which you should be getting. Alternatively, you can also take the serving before bed as this provides your body with the much needed aminos throughout the night. It’s when you’re sleeping, after all, that a lot of the muscle repairs take place.\n\nHowever, for certain days, such as your cheat days or rest days during a muscle building phase, taking a serving may not be necessary.\n\nAlso, besides the serving prior to workout, all other servings should preferably be taken with a meal and ideally one that contains a carb source.\n\nThe presence of carbohydrates boosts insulin, which helps drive more of the BCAAs into your muscles. Of course, this isn’t an absolute must; if you’re on a low carb diet, then don’t worry about it. Leucine is known to provide a slight insulin boost on its own anyways.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What About Dosage?</h3>\nFor first time users, <strong>start with just 2-3 grams</strong> to allow your stomach to adjust. From there, <strong>increase the dosage by a gram or two every two to three days, </strong>or until you reach the dosage listed on the bottle.\n\nEach dose should contain 5g to 10g of BCAAs. The lower end of the dosage is recommended if you weigh below 150lbs, with the higher end if you weigh over that figure.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">BCAAs for Women</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_79831194_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_79831194_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_79831194_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_79831194_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_79831194_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5616w\" alt=\"Attractive young woman drinking proteins\" />\n\nAt one point, BCAA use was mostly limited to bodybuilders preparing to lose fat in preparation for a competition. Since then, the supplement has become more commonplace and is used by many from the weekend gym rat to the professional athlete.\n\nMore women are beginning to take it as well, though many are still on the fences about BCAAs due to misconceptions about what they actually do.\n\nSome women I talk to fear that supplementing with BCAAs will make them bulky. First of all, BCAAs are not synthetic steroids. Yes, studies do show that usage increases testosterone, though by no means will women develop an Incredible Hulk-like physique.\n\nIf that were the case, most men who use it will be strutting around looking like Arnold in his bodybuilding heyday.\n\nWomen who aspire to strip body fat off their frame have every reason to supplement with BCAAs. <strong>This will help them retain muscle, which in turn, helps keep metabolism up.</strong>\n\nThere are BCAA supplements geared specifically towards women. Usually, these come with fancy packaging and a pink container to appeal to a female demographic. This is all gimmick and hype.\n\nIn most instances, the formula is identical to what you can find in a typical BCAA product. Some BCAA supplements marketed towards women may also claim to use ratios that are optimal for a female diet.\n\nThe normal ratio is about 2:1:1 for leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Some brands contain 3:1:1 or even 4:1:1.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">Revolt</a> actual has a 5:1:1 ratio for maximum benefits.</strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Regardless, the ratios apply for both men and women..</p><p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Taking BCAAs with Glutamine</h3>\nIf you’re really serious about your training, then consider stacking your BCAA with glutamine. The latter is a non-essential amino acid. Even though it’s produced naturally by your body, you can always use more glutamine especially before and after a workout.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10582122\">Studies</a> show that glutamine regulates healthy immune system functioning. This is a huge deal because strenuous exercise taxes the body and puts it under stress.\n\nThis can weaken your immune system and leave you vulnerable to illness. If you catch a case of the common cold or flu, then that is going to lead to missed days in the gym.\n\nFurthermore, this <a href=\"http://blog.predatornutrition.com/2012/02/02/bcaas-and-glutamine-useful-even-when-protein-intake-is-high/\">study</a> shows that subjects who took a BCAA and glutamine supplement along with whey experienced greater increases in lean muscle mass, fat loss, and strength gains compared to a group that took whey alone.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rpf7__C50Y8?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you are a serious athlete and train to failure upwards of five to six days a week, then a BCAA and glutamine stack is highly recommended..</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>I included glutamine in my new BCAA product <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">Revolt</a> to provide the benefits of taking them together.</strong>.</p><p>\nYou can also add <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\">Rebellion</a> to the equation, which contains a serving of <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">creatine</a> and will give you a strong pre-workout boost with its plethora of scientifically proven stimulants.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">BCAAs for Vegans</h3>\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of a vegan diet is the lack of viable protein source. Vegetarians have some leeway since they can get adequate protein from dairy, fish, and eggs.\n\nFor the most purest vegans, however, they are faced with a dilemma. They can’t even consume whey since it’s derived from milk. Sure, sources like nuts, legumes, and soy contain ample protein, but they are often missing some of the key essential amino acids.\n\nEven the ones that these sources do contain may not be fully digested by the body due to having a lower bioavailability.\n\nThis is where BCAA supplementation can come in extremely handy as it provides the essential aminos that vegans would otherwise be deficient in from an animal-free diet.\n\nVegans may also want to consider taking an amino acid supplement on top of a BCAA product to acquire the other essential amino acids.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Other Reasons to Take BCAAs (Besides for Muscle Retention)</h3>\nRecent scientific studies suggest that there are other reasons that warrant taking a BCAA supplement besides as a workout aid.\n\nSome people are beginning to use them for <strong>improving concentration and reducing brain fog. </strong>The kind that occurs when prepping for hours on end for an exam.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18704484\">study</a> shows that BCAAs <strong>improved short-term memory and offset fatigue</strong> of competitors in a 32-hour offshore sailing race. This isn’t to say that you should take BCAAs solely as a nootropic, but the research does suggest the positive effects of BCAAs on the brain.\n\nSome doctors also prescribe BCAAs to patients to help counteract certain conditions like Lou Gehrig’s disease and cognitive decline caused by liver disease.\n\nThis doesn’t mean, though, that you should automatically take BCAAs if you have any of the aforementioned conditions. Always consult with your doctor first to determine if BCAAs should be incorporated as part of a bigger treatment plan.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Trying to Lose Fat?

This is mostly due to lack of knowledge and misinformation.</p>\n\n<p>This is really unfortunate because BCAAs rank up there among other proven supplements like whey and <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">creatine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If used the right way and for its intended purpose, this can prove to be a valuable item in your quest for achieving your dream physique.</p>\n\n<p>By the time you reach the end of this post, you will have all the knowledge you need regarding BCAAs.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Are They?</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56713260_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x774.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56713260_Subscription_Monthly_XL-300x227.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56713260_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x774.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56713260_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg 3734w\" alt=\"young girl looking chalkboard with interrogation symbol\" /></p>\n\n<p>Branched chain amino acids, or BCAAs as they’re often called, are three very important amino acids. This includes <strong>leucine</strong>, <strong>isoleucine</strong>, and <strong>valine</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>These three are among the nine amino acids that are considered essential. By essential, this means they need to be acquired through food or supplementation since your body does not produce them as is the case with non-essential amino acids (comprising of 11 of the 20 AAs).</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this raises the question of what are amino acids. Simply put, <strong>they are the building blocks that make up the protein molecule, which in turn is what the muscles are made up of</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This is why a high-protein diet is recommended in just about every bodybuilding circle. Certain proteins, such as those found in meat and dairy, are especially high in BCAAs and other essential amino acids.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Makes BCAAs so Special Over the Other Amino Acids?</h3>  \n\n<p>So why do BCAAs deserve special attention over the remaining 17 amino acids?</p>\n\n<p>Well, all amino acids are important, <strong>but some serve more beneficial functions than others</strong>, especially with respects to muscle retention and gains.</p>\n\n<p>BCAAs happen to be at the forefront when it comes to lean muscle development.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, roughly a third of your muscles comprise of BCAAs. Also, unlike other amino acids, which are transported to the liver after being digested, BCAAs are shuttled straight to the muscles where they are used by muscle fibers for aiding in tissue repair and rebuilding.</p>\n\n<p>BCAAs also play a vital role in protein synthesis and keeping the body in a positive nitrogen balance, <strong>both of which are pivotal for muscle repair and recovery following a grueling workout</strong>. This equals muscle growth activation, or at the very least, muscle retention.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Who Should Take BCAAs?</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_89957529_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x546.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_89957529_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x80.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_89957529_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x160.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_89957529_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x546.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_89957529_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 7500w\" alt=\"Bodybuilding. Strong man and a woman posing on a dark background\" /></p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of discussions regarding the necessity of BCAAs. Since they’re available in most foods and whey powders, why are they necessary at all?</p>\n\n<p>Not everyone needs to supplement with BCAAs. <strong>They’re primarily recommended for people trying to lose fat while holding onto every bit of muscle</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s common knowledge that fat loss is accompanied by some muscle loss due to the calorie deficit. Taking a serving of BCAAs about 30 minutes prior to exercise provides the body with the three essential aminos needed to keep the body in a state of protein synthesis.</p>\n\n<p>This is crucial because when you work out on an empty stomach (<em>which I recommend you should be doing when training for fat loss</em>), your body is going to break down the protein in your muscles for energy. BCAAs can help reduce the rate of protein breakdown.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Why Not Just Eat More Protein?</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56772274_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x682.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56772274_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56772274_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56772274_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x682.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_56772274_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 4928w\" alt=\"Hungry man can not wait till meat is cooked\" /></p>\n\n<p>Since protein from sources like red meat and whey contain BCAAs, why not just consume protein before working out?</p>\n\n<p>There are two reasons this is not optimal...</p>\n\n<p><strong>First</strong>, if you consume protein, which contains calories, then you are no longer training on an empty stomach.</p>\n\n<p>BCAA supplements aren’t completely calorie-free, but the amount is negligible, usually around 10 or 20 calories per serving. If you have calories in your system when training, then the body is going to turn to them for fuel instead of targeting your fat stores.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, BCAAs in supplement form are far more bioavailable than the ones from food or protein powder. In the latter, the BCAAs are bonded to other amino acids and require a lengthy breakdown process in the digestive system.</p>\n\n<p>BCAA supplements contain just the three essential amino acids and are rapidly absorbed without undergoing a drawn out digestion process.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">It's All About Timing</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_83050618_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x600.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_83050618_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x88.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_83050618_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x176.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_83050618_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x600.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_83050618_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5184w\" alt=\"Time passing. Blue hourglass.\" /></p>\n\n<p>BCAAs aren’t a supplement that you take at your earliest convenience. <strong>The best time is to take the supplement is about half an hour before starting your workout</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Taking an additional serving immediately after workout is also a good idea since studies show that BCAAs help alleviate muscle soreness.</p>\n\n<p>The serving taken before workout, aside from preventing muscle catabolism, also increases energy output to help you train to your limit. Some BCAA products, such as <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">Revolt</a>, also contain <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/why-caffeine-will-always-be-the-greatest-natural-energy-booster/\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a> or other similar ingredients for an even more pronounced energy surge.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from taking a serving before and after, you can even take it right in the middle of a workout. This is only recommended if the workout exceeds one hour.</p>\n\n<p>Training, though, shouldn’t normally exceed 60 minutes. The only exception to this rule is if you perform cardio immediately following strength training, or if you’re training for endurance and performance rather than transforming your body.</p>\n\n<p>Some people may think that a dosage before, during, and after workout is a bit of an overkill. However, if you are training with full intensity, then your body will be needing all the nutrients and amino acids it can get.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">To Cycle or Not to Cycle?</h3>  \n\n<p>There is also the question of cycling BCAAs. Remember, BCAAs are just amino acids; just as you don’t need to cycle whey protein intake, it’s not necessary to cycle BCAAs.</p>\n\n<p>The supplement, after all, does contain a <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/8-benefits-of-using-a-bcaa-supplement/\" target=\"_blank\">multitude of benefits</a> that may prove to be helpful if taken continuously. However, if you do choose to cycle the supplement, take it when you begin your fat loss phase and go off it when on a muscle building plan.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">BCAA on Rest Days</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_92402846_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_92402846_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_92402846_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_92402846_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_92402846_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5616w\" alt=\"Young man relaxing on couch, teen pensive boy laying lazy on bed blue background\" /></p>\n\n<p>There is also the question of whether you should take BCAAs every day or only on your workout days. There really is no right or wrong answer here. Taking them every day certainly won’t hurt.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a good rule to follow: if you’re in a fat loss phase, then take a serving before and after workout on training days.</p>\n\n<p>As far as your rest days are concerned, take a serving first thing in the morning if you’re fasting or consuming fewer calories than normal.</p>\n\n<p>The addition of the BCAAs in your system after bed rise helps with muscle repair and is especially helpful given that your body just underwent an eight hour fast and is depleted of glycogen.</p>\n\n<p>That’s assuming, of course, that you’re getting eight hours of sleep, which you should be getting. Alternatively, you can also take the serving before bed as this provides your body with the much needed aminos throughout the night. It’s when you’re sleeping, after all, that a lot of the muscle repairs take place.</p>\n\n<p>However, for certain days, such as your cheat days or rest days during a muscle building phase, taking a serving may not be necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Also, besides the serving prior to workout, all other servings should preferably be taken with a meal and ideally one that contains a carb source.</p>\n\n<p>The presence of carbohydrates boosts insulin, which helps drive more of the BCAAs into your muscles. Of course, this isn’t an absolute must; if you’re on a low carb diet, then don’t worry about it. Leucine is known to provide a slight insulin boost on its own anyways.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What About Dosage?</h3>  \n\n<p>For first time users, <strong>start with just 2-3 grams</strong> to allow your stomach to adjust. From there, <strong>increase the dosage by a gram or two every two to three days, </strong>or until you reach the dosage listed on the bottle.</p>\n\n<p>Each dose should contain 5g to 10g of BCAAs. The lower end of the dosage is recommended if you weigh below 150lbs, with the higher end if you weigh over that figure.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">BCAAs for Women</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_79831194_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_79831194_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_79831194_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_79831194_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11110047/Fotolia_79831194_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5616w\" alt=\"Attractive young woman drinking proteins\" /></p>\n\n<p>At one point, BCAA use was mostly limited to bodybuilders preparing to lose fat in preparation for a competition. Since then, the supplement has become more commonplace and is used by many from the weekend gym rat to the professional athlete.</p>\n\n<p>More women are beginning to take it as well, though many are still on the fences about BCAAs due to misconceptions about what they actually do.</p>\n\n<p>Some women I talk to fear that supplementing with BCAAs will make them bulky. First of all, BCAAs are not synthetic steroids. Yes, studies do show that usage increases testosterone, though by no means will women develop an Incredible Hulk-like physique.</p>\n\n<p>If that were the case, most men who use it will be strutting around looking like Arnold in his bodybuilding heyday.</p>\n\n<p>Women who aspire to strip body fat off their frame have every reason to supplement with BCAAs. <strong>This will help them retain muscle, which in turn, helps keep metabolism up.</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are BCAA supplements geared specifically towards women. Usually, these come with fancy packaging and a pink container to appeal to a female demographic. This is all gimmick and hype.</p>\n\n<p>In most instances, the formula is identical to what you can find in a typical BCAA product. Some BCAA supplements marketed towards women may also claim to use ratios that are optimal for a female diet.</p>\n\n<p>The normal ratio is about 2:1:1 for leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Some brands contain 3:1:1 or even 4:1:1. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">Revolt</a> actual has a 5:1:1 ratio for maximum benefits.</strong>.</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Regardless, the ratios apply for both men and women..</p><p></p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Taking BCAAs with Glutamine</h3>  \n\n<p>If you’re really serious about your training, then consider stacking your BCAA with glutamine. The latter is a non-essential amino acid. Even though it’s produced naturally by your body, you can always use more glutamine especially before and after a workout.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10582122\">Studies</a> show that glutamine regulates healthy immune system functioning. This is a huge deal because strenuous exercise taxes the body and puts it under stress.</p>\n\n<p>This can weaken your immune system and leave you vulnerable to illness. If you catch a case of the common cold or flu, then that is going to lead to missed days in the gym.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, this <a href=\"http://blog.predatornutrition.com/2012/02/02/bcaas-and-glutamine-useful-even-when-protein-intake-is-high/\">study</a> shows that subjects who took a BCAA and glutamine supplement along with whey experienced greater increases in lean muscle mass, fat loss, and strength gains compared to a group that took whey alone.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rpf7__C50Y8?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>  \n\n<p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you are a serious athlete and train to failure upwards of five to six days a week, then a BCAA and glutamine stack is highly recommended..</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>I included glutamine in my new BCAA product <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">Revolt</a> to provide the benefits of taking them together.</strong>.</p><p> <br />\nYou can also add <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\">Rebellion</a> to the equation, which contains a serving of <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/supplement-with-creatine-monohydrate-for-lean-muscle-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">creatine</a> and will give you a strong pre-workout boost with its plethora of scientifically proven stimulants.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">BCAAs for Vegans</h3>  \n\n<p>One of the biggest drawbacks of a vegan diet is the lack of viable protein source. Vegetarians have some leeway since they can get adequate protein from dairy, fish, and eggs.</p>\n\n<p>For the most purest vegans, however, they are faced with a dilemma. They can’t even consume whey since it’s derived from milk. Sure, sources like nuts, legumes, and soy contain ample protein, but they are often missing some of the key essential amino acids.</p>\n\n<p>Even the ones that these sources do contain may not be fully digested by the body due to having a lower bioavailability.</p>\n\n<p>This is where BCAA supplementation can come in extremely handy as it provides the essential aminos that vegans would otherwise be deficient in from an animal-free diet.</p>\n\n<p>Vegans may also want to consider taking an amino acid supplement on top of a BCAA product to acquire the other essential amino acids.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Other Reasons to Take BCAAs (Besides for Muscle Retention)</h3>  \n\n<p>Recent scientific studies suggest that there are other reasons that warrant taking a BCAA supplement besides as a workout aid.</p>\n\n<p>Some people are beginning to use them for <strong>improving concentration and reducing brain fog. </strong>The kind that occurs when prepping for hours on end for an exam.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18704484\">study</a> shows that BCAAs <strong>improved short-term memory and offset fatigue</strong> of competitors in a 32-hour offshore sailing race. This isn’t to say that you should take BCAAs solely as a nootropic, but the research does suggest the positive effects of BCAAs on the brain.</p>\n\n<p>Some doctors also prescribe BCAAs to patients to help counteract certain conditions like Lou Gehrig’s disease and cognitive decline caused by liver disease.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn’t mean, though, that you should automatically take BCAAs if you have any of the aforementioned conditions. Always consult with your doctor first to determine if BCAAs should be incorporated as part of a bigger treatment plan.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Trying to Lose Fat?

Cardio","slug":"everything-you-need-to-know-about-hiit-cardio","markdown":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Have you ever wondered what this whole High Intensity Interval Training cardio was about? Here is everything you need to know about HIIT cardio.</h3>\nIt’s crazy how so few people are unaware of HIIT despite its proven superiority over traditional cardio. If your mind is dead set on losing as much body fat as possible, then this is a workout that you will benefit immensely from.\n\nIf you’re completely new to this type of training and don’t even know what HIIT stands for (high-intensity interval training), then read on.\n\nBy the time you finish, not only will you know everything there is to know about HIIT, but you will be able to implement your first workout and get started as soon as today.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">History of HIIT</h3>\nAthletes have been adhering to training similar to HIIT for years; it just wasn’t called that.\n\nAs such, HIIT really has no specific origin, though there are many guesses. Some claim the concept was invented by the Scandinavians in the 1930s. Others claim that it was started much later by famed athletic coach Peter Coe, who used the method to train his son in the 1970s.\n\nStill, others claim that HIIT as we know it today didn’t really get off the ground until the mid-1990s with the rollout of Tabata HIIT, a variation of the training created by sport and health science professor Izumi Tabata.\n\nUltimately, asking who invented HIIT is like asking who invented running or weight lifting. It has been around for as long as it has because of its <strong>immense fat loss and cardiovascular benefits</strong>.\n\nEven celebrities like David Beckham, Queen Latifah, and Giuliana Rancic have been known to do HIIT.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"> High Intensity Interval Training 101</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_94628449_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_94628449_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_94628449_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_94628449_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_94628449_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 7195w\" alt=\"Sprinter leaving starting blocks on the running track. Explosive start.\" />\n\nThe name kind of says it all. High intensity implies that you will be going at a high pace, meaning that you will be panting heavily and gasping desperately for breath within a few minutes or seconds.\n\nThis is where HIIT differs from your ordinary cardio done for 30 minutes. With HIIT, if done the right way, you will be absolutely spent by the time you complete the 15-20 minute workout.\n\nWith HIIT, you typically exercise at around 80% to 90% VO2 max, compared to about 50% to 60% VO2 max with regular aerobics, hence why you’re able to maintain the exercise at a steady pace for half an hour or more.\n\n<em>What does it mean by VO2 max?</em>\n\nThe term refers to the measurement of oxygen your body is able to use during exercise.You will likely hear the term used a lot when HIIT is being discussed, especially when it involves scientific studies.\n\nFor the most part, this is all you need to know: t<strong>he more intense the exercise the higher your VO2 max</strong>.\n\nTraining at a higher VO2 max is absolutely necessary if you hope to see improvement in your body composition. This goes for both losing fat and gaining muscle.\n\nIt goes without saying that if you’re training near your VO2 max that you won’t be able to maintain the same intensity for long, which is precisely why a HIIT workout comprises of separate exercises completed in intervals with short rests in between.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Why Training at a High VO2 Max Matters</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96960431_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96960431_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96960431_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96960431_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96960431_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5760w\" alt=\"tired woman runner taking a rest after running hard on sunshine seaside\" />\n\n<em>So why should you opt for HIIT over traditional cardio?</em>\n\nFor one, it’s a time saver. When it comes to exercise, <strong>quality is always more important than quantity</strong>. With that in mind, 15-20 minutes of HIIT beats out 30-45 minutes of steady-state aerobics on a treadmill or stationary bike.\n\nEven more importantly, you will see better results. By better, this means <strong>more fat loss while preserving muscle</strong>.\n\nTraditional cardio has long been criticized for its muscle catabolic effects. The fact is, when you train at only moderate intensity, the body will turn to two sources for fuel once its glycogen stores are used up: triglycerides from your fat cells, and protein from muscle tissue.\n\n<strong>The higher you train near your VO2 max, the greater ratio of body fat to muscle tissue is burned</strong>.\n\nInterestingly, training towards the low end of your VO2 max also burns a greater ratio of fat to muscle. For this reason, a brisk walk is also effective for burning fat, though you’ll have to do A LOT of walking to see any real results. By a lot, this means around one hour five to six times a week!\n\nIt’s when you train at the moderate VO2 max level, such as in a brisk jog, that the body tends to burn nearly just as much muscle as it does fat.\n\nThis is why HIIT is so beneficial...\n\n<strong>It burns more fat, preserves muscle, and is a massive time saver if your schedule is consumed with work and family priorities.</strong>\n\nAside from toning you up, HIIT has also been shown to contain a number of side benefits that makes the workout worthwhile even if you’re not particularly interested in achieving a better body definition.\n\nThis has been shown in this <a href=\"http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/apnm-2013-0187#.VpV1AhUrLIU\">study</a> where subjects improved aerobic endurance, muscle oxidative capacity, exercise tolerance, and decreased risk for disease after just a few weeks of a HIIT regimen.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">How to do HIIT</h3>\nOne of the other benefits of HIIT is the near endless ways the workout can be done. There are multiple exercises that can be performed in any combination that you see fit.\n\nAs such, you’ll have more ways you’ll be able to change up the workout, thus preventing your body from adapting to any one style of training.\n\nThe typical HIIT lasts for 15-20 minutes and consists of short exercises done for 20-30 seconds followed by a 20-30 second rest.\n\nSome ways to do HIIT include aerobic movements (such as plyometrics), ab circuits, running in place, or doing jumping jacks at a high speed.\n\nA sample HIIT routine may look something like this:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Bodyweight squats</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Clapping pushups</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Box jumps</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Isometric wall sit</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Burpees</td>\n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle x2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nOf course, there are millions of ways to mix it up with respects to exercise selection, exercise duration, and rest period.\n\nIf you have access to a track, a HIIT workout can also consist completely of short bursts of quick sprints or running over a set of bleachers.\n\nIf you’re feeling unstoppable and can take on the mountain, then try HIIT using a high altitude mask or speed resistance training parachute.\n\nI have a multitude of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/HighLifeWorkout\">free HIIT workouts</a> on my youtube channel you can follow as well.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Do You Need any Equipment?</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96816667_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x696.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96816667_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x102.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96816667_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x204.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96816667_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x696.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96816667_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5811w\" alt=\"Sports equipment for bodybuilding collected in a heap\" />\n\nThe sample workout above requires zero equipment, though feel free to add free weights, kettle bells, or resistance bands if you feel the exercises are getting too easy.\n\nRemember, just as you need to progressively add more weights or increase more reps in weight lifting, you need to do the same with HIIT.\n\nFor the box jumps or bodyweight squats, for example, you can add resistance by donning a weight vest or carrying a light barbell on your back.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Training Frequency</h3>\nSince HIIT is more taxing on the body, you will need to make sure you're recovering in between workouts. This is especially the case if you’re also incorporating resistance training, which you should be doing as well.\n\nAs far as timing goes, HIIT is best right when you get out of bed and before consuming your first meal of the day. Alternatively, you can also perform HIIT right after your strength training workout when the body has just used up its glycogen stores.\n\nBasically, you want to be training when your stomach is empty. This forces your body to expend body fat as fuel.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Be Forewarned; HIIT Is no Walk in the Park</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/IMG_4559-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4937px) 100vw, 4937px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/IMG_4559-e1452795529442-150x94.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/IMG_4559-e1452795529442-300x187.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/IMG_4559-e1452795529442-1024x640.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/IMG_4559-e1452795529442.jpg 4937w\" alt=\"IMG_4559\" />\n\nEven people who are normally in good shape struggle when doing HIIT for the first time. If you are out of shape, then it’s possible that you won't be able to complete a full workout, or at least not without cheating by not doing the exercises at full intensity.\n\nIn any case, you need to ease into the workout to get your body accustomed to the high pace movement.\n\nStart slow and do what you can. In the beginning, you may only be able to go for five minutes, and that’s fine. You can always work your way up by adding extra exercises until you’re able to get in a full 15-20 minutes.\n\nAnother way to make HIIT easier is by shortening the exercise duration while lengthening the rest time. This may be something like a 20 second exercise and 40 second rest as opposed to an even 30/30.\n\nYou can also perform an easier variation of most exercises, which is demonstrated in this video below that takes you through an entire HIIT session.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jr6DuNMTQBc?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Give It a Try</strong></h3>\nHIIT is a training regimen that you will likely develop a love-hate relationship with.

Here is everything you need to know about HIIT cardio.</h3>  \n\n<p>It’s crazy how so few people are unaware of HIIT despite its proven superiority over traditional cardio. If your mind is dead set on losing as much body fat as possible, then this is a workout that you will benefit immensely from.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re completely new to this type of training and don’t even know what HIIT stands for (high-intensity interval training), then read on.</p>\n\n<p>By the time you finish, not only will you know everything there is to know about HIIT, but you will be able to implement your first workout and get started as soon as today.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">History of HIIT</h3>  \n\n<p>Athletes have been adhering to training similar to HIIT for years; it just wasn’t called that.</p>\n\n<p>As such, HIIT really has no specific origin, though there are many guesses. Some claim the concept was invented by the Scandinavians in the 1930s. Others claim that it was started much later by famed athletic coach Peter Coe, who used the method to train his son in the 1970s.</p>\n\n<p>Still, others claim that HIIT as we know it today didn’t really get off the ground until the mid-1990s with the rollout of Tabata HIIT, a variation of the training created by sport and health science professor Izumi Tabata.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, asking who invented HIIT is like asking who invented running or weight lifting. It has been around for as long as it has because of its <strong>immense fat loss and cardiovascular benefits</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Even celebrities like David Beckham, Queen Latifah, and Giuliana Rancic have been known to do HIIT.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"> High Intensity Interval Training 101</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_94628449_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_94628449_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_94628449_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_94628449_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_94628449_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 7195w\" alt=\"Sprinter leaving starting blocks on the running track. Explosive start.\" /></p>\n\n<p>The name kind of says it all. High intensity implies that you will be going at a high pace, meaning that you will be panting heavily and gasping desperately for breath within a few minutes or seconds.</p>\n\n<p>This is where HIIT differs from your ordinary cardio done for 30 minutes. With HIIT, if done the right way, you will be absolutely spent by the time you complete the 15-20 minute workout.</p>\n\n<p>With HIIT, you typically exercise at around 80% to 90% VO2 max, compared to about 50% to 60% VO2 max with regular aerobics, hence why you’re able to maintain the exercise at a steady pace for half an hour or more.</p>\n\n<p><em>What does it mean by VO2 max?</em></p>\n\n<p>The term refers to the measurement of oxygen your body is able to use during exercise.You will likely hear the term used a lot when HIIT is being discussed, especially when it involves scientific studies.</p>\n\n<p>For the most part, this is all you need to know: t<strong>he more intense the exercise the higher your VO2 max</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Training at a higher VO2 max is absolutely necessary if you hope to see improvement in your body composition. This goes for both losing fat and gaining muscle.</p>\n\n<p>It goes without saying that if you’re training near your VO2 max that you won’t be able to maintain the same intensity for long, which is precisely why a HIIT workout comprises of separate exercises completed in intervals with short rests in between.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Why Training at a High VO2 Max Matters</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96960431_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96960431_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x100.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96960431_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x200.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96960431_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96960431_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5760w\" alt=\"tired woman runner taking a rest after running hard on sunshine seaside\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>So why should you opt for HIIT over traditional cardio?</em></p>\n\n<p>For one, it’s a time saver. When it comes to exercise, <strong>quality is always more important than quantity</strong>. With that in mind, 15-20 minutes of HIIT beats out 30-45 minutes of steady-state aerobics on a treadmill or stationary bike.</p>\n\n<p>Even more importantly, you will see better results. By better, this means <strong>more fat loss while preserving muscle</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional cardio has long been criticized for its muscle catabolic effects. The fact is, when you train at only moderate intensity, the body will turn to two sources for fuel once its glycogen stores are used up: triglycerides from your fat cells, and protein from muscle tissue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The higher you train near your VO2 max, the greater ratio of body fat to muscle tissue is burned</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, training towards the low end of your VO2 max also burns a greater ratio of fat to muscle. For this reason, a brisk walk is also effective for burning fat, though you’ll have to do A LOT of walking to see any real results. By a lot, this means around one hour five to six times a week!</p>\n\n<p>It’s when you train at the moderate VO2 max level, such as in a brisk jog, that the body tends to burn nearly just as much muscle as it does fat.</p>\n\n<p>This is why HIIT is so beneficial...</p>\n\n<p><strong>It burns more fat, preserves muscle, and is a massive time saver if your schedule is consumed with work and family priorities.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aside from toning you up, HIIT has also been shown to contain a number of side benefits that makes the workout worthwhile even if you’re not particularly interested in achieving a better body definition.</p>\n\n<p>This has been shown in this <a href=\"http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/apnm-2013-0187#.VpV1AhUrLIU\">study</a> where subjects improved aerobic endurance, muscle oxidative capacity, exercise tolerance, and decreased risk for disease after just a few weeks of a HIIT regimen.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">How to do HIIT</h3>  \n\n<p>One of the other benefits of HIIT is the near endless ways the workout can be done. There are multiple exercises that can be performed in any combination that you see fit.</p>\n\n<p>As such, you’ll have more ways you’ll be able to change up the workout, thus preventing your body from adapting to any one style of training.</p>\n\n<p>The typical HIIT lasts for 15-20 minutes and consists of short exercises done for 20-30 seconds followed by a 20-30 second rest.</p>\n\n<p>Some ways to do HIIT include aerobic movements (such as plyometrics), ab circuits, running in place, or doing jumping jacks at a high speed.</p>\n\n<p>A sample HIIT routine may look something like this:  </p>\n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Bodyweight squats</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Clapping pushups</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Box jumps</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Isometric wall sit</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Burpees</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">30 seconds</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">30 second rest</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\">Repeat cycle x2</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<p>Of course, there are millions of ways to mix it up with respects to exercise selection, exercise duration, and rest period.</p>\n\n<p>If you have access to a track, a HIIT workout can also consist completely of short bursts of quick sprints or running over a set of bleachers.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re feeling unstoppable and can take on the mountain, then try HIIT using a high altitude mask or speed resistance training parachute.</p>\n\n<p>I have a multitude of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/HighLifeWorkout\">free HIIT workouts</a> on my youtube channel you can follow as well.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Do You Need any Equipment?</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96816667_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x696.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96816667_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-150x102.jpg 150w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96816667_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-300x204.jpg 300w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96816667_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x696.jpg 1024w,http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18110022/Fotolia_96816667_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg 5811w\" alt=\"Sports equipment for bodybuilding collected in a heap\" /></p>\n\n<p>The sample workout above requires zero equipment, though feel free to add free weights, kettle bells, or resistance bands if you feel the exercises are getting too easy.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, just as you need to progressively add more weights or increase more reps in weight lifting, you need to do the same with HIIT.</p>\n\n<p>For the box jumps or bodyweight squats, for example, you can add resistance by donning a weight vest or carrying a light barbell on your back.  </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Training Frequency</h3>  \n\n<p>Since HIIT is more taxing on the body, you will need to make sure you're recovering in between workouts.

Common Misconceptions About HIIT Cardio That Need to STOP!","slug":"9-common-misconceptions-about-hiit-cardio-that-need-to-stop","markdown":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">There is a lot of uncertainty about the effectiveness of HIIT Cardio that simply isn't true. Here are some of the most common misconceptions about HIIT cardio.</h3>\nHIIT is hands down simply one of the best forms of cardio you can do if your aim is to blowtorch the fat off your body while holding onto muscle.\n\nThere’s a lot of literature regarding HIIT, though, that are misleading or outright false. If you make the decision to incorporate HIIT into your training routine and stick to it, then good for you.\n\nHowever, you should know what this style of cardio is and isn’t. Once the misconceptions are cleared out of the way, you can approach the training with a greater understanding of how HIIT can help you achieve your fitness goals!\n<h3>Misconception #1: Anyone Can Do HIIT</h3>\nCan anyone run a marathon, or even a half-marathon for that matter? Of course not; it takes months of training and prepping your body for such an extreme endurance challenge.\n\nThe same can be said about HIIT. If you’ve been a couch potato for many years and are breaking out your first pair of running shoes since high school P.E., then you’re not going to have the physical capacity to complete a HIIT session all the way through.\n\nThis doesn’t mean HIIT will always be out of your range. It just means you have to ease into it. The average HIIT session is about 15-20 minutes. If you’re a beginner, just do what you can; perhaps that means just five minutes, extending the rest times, shortening the exercise duration, or a combination of the three.\n<h3>Misconception #2: HIIT Is all You Need to Transform Your Body</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22110056/Fotolia_49204717_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x805.jpg\" alt=\"Funny retro nerd flexing his muscle\" />\n\nIf all you did was HIIT, you will certainly see some good results and lose weight, but imagine how much more fat you could lose if you also incorporated weight training and the right diet?\n\nRemember, weight loss occurs when there is a calorie deficit. Sure, HIIT will boost your metabolism, but that alone won’t have as profound of an impact if it’s all you do.\n\nYou also have to consume overall fewer calories and keep up with a resistance training regimen. With resistance training, the additional lean muscle mass gained will raise thermogenesis even more, since muscles require calorie expenditure to maintain.\n\nThink of it this way: <em>are you content with sort-of visible abs, or do you want abs that are completely rippled with the full vascularity and definition?</em>\n\nThe former is the best you can get if you did nothing but HIIT. For the best results, HIIT has to be a part of a complete weight loss program that includes resistance training, dieting, and supplementing with a fat burner like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>.\n<h3>Misconception #3: The More HIIT You Do the Better</h3>\nJust because HIIT is extremely effective does not mean that doing twice the sessions will equal twice the results.\n\nWanting to see results in as little time as possible, some people ramp up the number of HIIT workouts, sometimes doing multiple sessions a day.\n\nDue to the intense nature of HIIT, your body needs ample resting time between workouts. Doing HIIT multiple times a day will only result in diminished performance, thus grinding fat loss to a halt.\n<h3>Misconception #4: HIIT Will Bulk You Up</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22110056/Fotolia_99235888_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"646229\" />\n\nThis misconception is one of the reasons women tend to shy away from HIIT in favor of more traditional cardio. HIIT, like other forms of cardio, is an aerobics workout, which do not build muscle.\n\nIt’s true that HIIT does increase testosterone, as proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23310924\">study</a>. However, the testosterone surge is not enough to morph you into an Incredible Hulk minus the green pigment. This is especially the case for females whose bodies do not naturally produce enough testosterone to warrant huge muscle gains.\n\nEven if you do gain some muscle from it,<strong> that’s actually a good thing as it increases definition and raises metabolism.</strong>\n\nAt best, HIIT will help you retain your current muscle mass while burning off fat. This is why it’s heralded as one of the best forms of cardio.\n\nAll the talk about HIIT being for men is utter nonsense. The notion is just as outdated as the idea that women should stick to pink dumbbells and yoga mats while leaving the weight room to men.\n<h3>Misconception #5: The Timing of Your HIIT Sessions Doesn't Matter</h3>\nWhen it comes to cardio, and HIIT especially, timing is important. For the most part, there are two best times you should be doing HIIT:\n\nfirst thing in the morning (before breakfast), and immediately after your strength training.\n\nIf neither of these times is possible, then you may get in your cardio at least four hours after your last meal, though the other two options are better.\n\n<em>So why first thing in the morning and after weight training?</em>\n\nIn the morning, your body is depleted of glycogen, having gone through an overnight fast. The same goes after a workout since the glycogen is completely used up by the body during the rigorous training.\n\nIf you do HIIT when glycogen stores are near-empty, <strong>the body will be forced to eat into your body fat as an energy reserve</strong>.\n<h3>Misconception #6: HIIT Is Effective for Spot Reducing</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22110056/Fotolia_64720114_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Overweight man pinches the excess fat that he has around his waist.\" />\n\nHere’s the deal: spot reducing isn’t possible, <strong>PERIOD</strong>!\n\nThis is the case regardless of the type of exercise or cardio you perform. This was proven in a <a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=685700\">1971 study</a>. The idea of spot reduction is certainly an appealing idea. After all, most people have a problem area or two.\n\nFor men, this is often their waistline that has morphed into a beer gut. For women, this is usually areas like the hips, thighs, and upper arms.\n\nRegardless, all fat loss plans should be treated as a total fat loss strategy rather than a belly fat loss, thigh fat loss, arm fat loss, etc.\n\nIn an attempt to address a problem area, some people select exercises for HIIT that specifically target a certain muscle group. First of all, your exercises should consist of exercises that incorporate various muscle groups. This way, one muscle can rest while you’re doing another exercise.\n\nNo matter how in shape you are, you will not be able to perform similar exercises that hit the same muscle for the entire 15-20 minute duration while maintaining a high intensity.\n<h3>Misconception #7: Any Exercise Can Be Done with HIIT</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22110056/Fotolia_86265174_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x883.jpg\" alt=\"Thoughtful businessman with questions marks\" />\n\nBy all means, feel free to change up your HIIT routine by incorporating various exercises. Not all exercises, however, will suffice. Ideally, the exercises should, at least in part, compose of compound movements.\n\nSuch movements, such as squats, pushups, pullups, and kettlebell swings do a much better job at taxing your cardiovascular system and leave you breathing heavily in a short amount of time.\n\nSure, an exercise like bicep curls will burn your arms, but it will hardly have you gasping for breath. Put it this way; if you can speak while doing a HIIT workout, then the exercise isn’t intense enough.\n\nThis isn’t to say, though, that you can never include isolation movements. A lot of HIIT workouts, in fact, include ab exercises, which for the most part, only work the abs.\n\nHere is a list of exercises that work great for HIIT:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong>Compound Movements</strong></td>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong>Aerobic Movements</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Squats (body weight or using a light weight)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">sprinting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Pushups (regular or a variation like clapping pushups)</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Cardio kickboxing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">lunges</td>\n<td width=\"319\"> Jump roping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Pullups, or pulldowns</td>\n<td width=\"319\">Running in place</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Any type of rowing exercise</td>\n<td width=\"319\">High jumps</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Misconception #8: HIIt Is the Same as SMIT</h3>\nThere is also another mode of training known as Supramaximal Training (SMIT) that is often mistaken for HIIT. While similar in nature, HIIT and SMIT are not terms that should be used interchangeably.\n\nWith HIIT, you train at about 80%-90% of your VO2 max, followed by brief rest periods of 20 to 30 seconds. With SMIT, you go all out and train at 100% VO2 max, followed by a longer rest period of about two to three minutes.\n\nSMIT is simply another way of training and is not better or worse than HIIT.\n\nIt is recommended, though, that you stick mostly with HIIT for the simple reason that the method has been out longer, and there are more studies backing up the validity of HIIT, such as in this <a href=\"https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/HIITvsCardio.html\">report</a> from researchers at University of New Mexico.\n<h3>Misconception #10: HIIT Should Only Be Done During a Fat Loss Phase</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22110056/Fotolia_65315304_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of female feet standing on a bathroom scale\" />\n\nIt’s up to you whether you want to maintain some form of cardio workout during a muscle building phase. It’s not an absolute must, but forgoing HIIT when you’re consuming a calorie surplus will result in some fat gains.\n\nSince HIIT burns mostly body fat, it will keep fat gains at bay. It’s not likely (but not impossible) that you will lose fat due to the extra food consumption, but you will definitely offset some of the fat that you would otherwise have gained.\n<h3>HIIT Is One of the Best Weapons for Fat Loss, Bar None</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22110056/IMG_9039-1024x881.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9039\" />\n\nHIIT, if done the right way and in conjunction with strength training and dieting, will get rid of the stubborn body fat that you have ever so loathed.\n\nNow that some of the common misconceptions are corrected, you can approach this way of training without false notions or ideas that may lead to improper implementation.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you want to use HIIT to help burn fat and get shredded, then you're going to want to get my BRAND NEW program <a href=\"http://www.directhiit.com\" target=\"_blank\">Direct HIIT</a>.</strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This program will teach you how to sculpt the lean, ripped body of your dreams!.</p><p>\"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">There is a lot of uncertainty about the effectiveness of HIIT Cardio that simply isn't true. Here are some of the most common misconceptions about HIIT cardio.</h3>  \n\n<p>HIIT is hands down simply one of the best forms of cardio you can do if your aim is to blowtorch the fat off your body while holding onto muscle.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a lot of literature regarding HIIT, though, that are misleading or outright false. If you make the decision to incorporate HIIT into your training routine and stick to it, then good for you.</p>\n\n<p>However, you should know what this style of cardio is and isn’t. Once the misconceptions are cleared out of the way, you can approach the training with a greater understanding of how HIIT can help you achieve your fitness goals!  </p>\n\n<h3>Misconception #1: Anyone Can Do HIIT</h3>  \n\n<p>Can anyone run a marathon, or even a half-marathon for that matter? Of course not; it takes months of training and prepping your body for such an extreme endurance challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The same can be said about HIIT. If you’ve been a couch potato for many years and are breaking out your first pair of running shoes since high school P.E., then you’re not going to have the physical capacity to complete a HIIT session all the way through.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn’t mean HIIT will always be out of your range. It just means you have to ease into it. The average HIIT session is about 15-20 minutes. If you’re a beginner, just do what you can; perhaps that means just five minutes, extending the rest times, shortening the exercise duration, or a combination of the three.  </p>\n\n<h3>Misconception #2: HIIT Is all You Need to Transform Your Body</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22110056/Fotolia_49204717_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x805.jpg\" alt=\"Funny retro nerd flexing his muscle\" /></p>\n\n<p>If all you did was HIIT, you will certainly see some good results and lose weight, but imagine how much more fat you could lose if you also incorporated weight training and the right diet?</p>\n\n<p>Remember, weight loss occurs when there is a calorie deficit. Sure, HIIT will boost your metabolism, but that alone won’t have as profound of an impact if it’s all you do.</p>\n\n<p>You also have to consume overall fewer calories and keep up with a resistance training regimen. With resistance training, the additional lean muscle mass gained will raise thermogenesis even more, since muscles require calorie expenditure to maintain.</p>\n\n<p>Think of it this way: <em>are you content with sort-of visible abs, or do you want abs that are completely rippled with the full vascularity and definition?</em></p>\n\n<p>The former is the best you can get if you did nothing but HIIT. For the best results, HIIT has to be a part of a complete weight loss program that includes resistance training, dieting, and supplementing with a fat burner like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>.  </p>\n\n<h3>Misconception #3: The More HIIT You Do the Better</h3>  \n\n<p>Just because HIIT is extremely effective does not mean that doing twice the sessions will equal twice the results.</p>\n\n<p>Wanting to see results in as little time as possible, some people ramp up the number of HIIT workouts, sometimes doing multiple sessions a day.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the intense nature of HIIT, your body needs ample resting time between workouts. Doing HIIT multiple times a day will only result in diminished performance, thus grinding fat loss to a halt.  </p>\n\n<h3>Misconception #4: HIIT Will Bulk You Up</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22110056/Fotolia_99235888_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"646229\" /></p>\n\n<p>This misconception is one of the reasons women tend to shy away from HIIT in favor of more traditional cardio. HIIT, like other forms of cardio, is an aerobics workout, which do not build muscle.</p>\n\n<p>It’s true that HIIT does increase testosterone, as proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23310924\">study</a>. However, the testosterone surge is not enough to morph you into an Incredible Hulk minus the green pigment. This is especially the case for females whose bodies do not naturally produce enough testosterone to warrant huge muscle gains.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you do gain some muscle from it,<strong> that’s actually a good thing as it increases definition and raises metabolism.</strong></p>\n\n<p>At best, HIIT will help you retain your current muscle mass while burning off fat. This is why it’s heralded as one of the best forms of cardio.</p>\n\n<p>All the talk about HIIT being for men is utter nonsense. The notion is just as outdated as the idea that women should stick to pink dumbbells and yoga mats while leaving the weight room to men.  </p>\n\n<h3>Misconception #5: The Timing of Your HIIT Sessions Doesn't Matter</h3>  \n\n<p>When it comes to cardio, and HIIT especially, timing is important. For the most part, there are two best times you should be doing HIIT:</p>\n\n<p>first thing in the morning (before breakfast), and immediately after your strength training.</p>\n\n<p>If neither of these times is possible, then you may get in your cardio at least four hours after your last meal, though the other two options are better.</p>\n\n<p><em>So why first thing in the morning and after weight training?</em></p>\n\n<p>In the morning, your body is depleted of glycogen, having gone through an overnight fast. The same goes after a workout since the glycogen is completely used up by the body during the rigorous training.</p>\n\n<p>If you do HIIT when glycogen stores are near-empty, <strong>the body will be forced to eat into your body fat as an energy reserve</strong>.  </p>\n\n<h3>Misconception #6: HIIT Is Effective for Spot Reducing</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22110056/Fotolia_64720114_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Overweight man pinches the excess fat that he has around his waist.\" /></p>\n\n<p>Here’s the deal: spot reducing isn’t possible, <strong>PERIOD</strong>!</p>\n\n<p>This is the case regardless of the type of exercise or cardio you perform. This was proven in a <a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=685700\">1971 study</a>. The idea of spot reduction is certainly an appealing idea. After all, most people have a problem area or two.</p>\n\n<p>For men, this is often their waistline that has morphed into a beer gut. For women, this is usually areas like the hips, thighs, and upper arms.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, all fat loss plans should be treated as a total fat loss strategy rather than a belly fat loss, thigh fat loss, arm fat loss, etc.</p>\n\n<p>In an attempt to address a problem area, some people select exercises for HIIT that specifically target a certain muscle group. First of all, your exercises should consist of exercises that incorporate various muscle groups. This way, one muscle can rest while you’re doing another exercise.</p>\n\n<p>No matter how in shape you are, you will not be able to perform similar exercises that hit the same muscle for the entire 15-20 minute duration while maintaining a high intensity.  </p>\n\n<h3>Misconception #7: Any Exercise Can Be Done with HIIT</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22110056/Fotolia_86265174_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x883.jpg\" alt=\"Thoughtful businessman with questions marks\" /></p>\n\n<p>By all means, feel free to change up your HIIT routine by incorporating various exercises. Not all exercises, however, will suffice. Ideally, the exercises should, at least in part, compose of compound movements.</p>\n\n<p>Such movements, such as squats, pushups, pullups, and kettlebell swings do a much better job at taxing your cardiovascular system and leave you breathing heavily in a short amount of time.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, an exercise like bicep curls will burn your arms, but it will hardly have you gasping for breath. Put it this way; if you can speak while doing a HIIT workout, then the exercise isn’t intense enough.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t to say, though, that you can never include isolation movements. A lot of HIIT workouts, in fact, include ab exercises, which for the most part, only work the abs.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a list of exercises that work great for HIIT:  </p>\n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\"><strong>Compound Movements</strong></td>  \n<td width=\"319\"><strong>Aerobic Movements</strong></td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Squats (body weight or using a light weight)</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">sprinting</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Pushups (regular or a variation like clapping pushups)</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Cardio kickboxing</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">lunges</td>  \n<td width=\"319\"> Jump roping</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Pullups, or pulldowns</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">Running in place</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Any type of rowing exercise</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">High jumps</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<h3>Misconception #8: HIIt Is the Same as SMIT</h3>  \n\n<p>There is also another mode of training known as Supramaximal Training (SMIT) that is often mistaken for HIIT. While similar in nature, HIIT and SMIT are not terms that should be used interchangeably.</p>\n\n<p>With HIIT, you train at about 80%-90% of your VO2 max, followed by brief rest periods of 20 to 30 seconds. With SMIT, you go all out and train at 100% VO2 max, followed by a longer rest period of about two to three minutes.</p>\n\n<p>SMIT is simply another way of training and is not better or worse than HIIT.</p>\n\n<p>It is recommended, though, that you stick mostly with HIIT for the simple reason that the method has been out longer, and there are more studies backing up the validity of HIIT, such as in this <a href=\"https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/HIITvsCardio.html\">report</a> from researchers at University of New Mexico.  </p>\n\n<h3>Misconception #10: HIIT Should Only Be Done During a Fat Loss Phase</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22110056/Fotolia_65315304_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of female feet standing on a bathroom scale\" /></p>\n\n<p>It’s up to you whether you want to maintain some form of cardio workout during a muscle building phase.

Here are the proven reasons why HIIT is superior to traditional cardio.</h3>\nPeople fall into different categories when it comes to opinion over which style of cardio is best. If you’re currently one of those people who slave away on the treadmill for 30 minutes or longer, then you may want to reconsider the way you train.\n\nWithout further ado, here are a few ways HIIT beats out old-style cardio.\n<h3>Reason #1: HIIT Burns More Fat</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/Fotolia_27002551_Subscription_Monthly_L-1024x530.jpg\" alt=\"bright flamy symbol on the black background\" />\n\nIt’s worth switching over to HIIT for this reason alone. <strong>HIIT is simply more effective at targeting fat stores.</strong>\n\nThis is for the simple reason that it elevates your metabolism for a longer period of time after the workout. This results in more overall calories burned even if you remain mostly sedentary after the exercise.\n\nEven more importantly, a greater percentage of the weight loss comes from body fat. This was proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8028502\">study</a> that compared a 15-week HIIT regimen to a 20-week traditional cardio program.\n\nSubjects in the latter group actually lost 15,000 more calories than the HIIT group. Those that did HIIT, though, lost a greater percentage of body fat.\n\nAn <a href=\"http://dc.etsu.edu/etd/123/\">East Tennessee State University study</a> revealed similar results, where subjects that performed HIIT for eight weeks saw a 2% reduction in body fat, compared to zero changes for a traditional cardio group.\n\nWeight loss isn’t just about overall calories burned; the percentages matter.\n\nLosing weight doesn’t necessarily improve your physique. In fact, it can make you look even worse if a greater percentage of the weight loss comes from muscle. This explains why marathon runners often look gaunt with the skinny-fat build.\n<h3>Reason #2: HIIT Preserves Muscle</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_93136803_Subscription_Monthly_L-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Personal fitness trainer holding tape measure isolated over gray background. Closeup of muscular man measuring his waist. Doing perfect six pack abs.\" />\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of steady-state cardio is the eventual muscle loss.\n\nYou will lose some body fat with traditional aerobics, but a bit of muscle will be collateral damage. This can especially be disheartening for men who are trying to lose fat following months of a rigorous bulk-up phase.\n\n<strong>Losing muscle that was built on the back of pain, sweat, and dedication can be soul-crushing.</strong>\n\nThis is precisely why cardio should comprise of HIIT. When combined with resistance training and supplementation with a <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">BCAA product</a>, you will hold onto muscle while burning away at your body’s fat stores.\n\nWhen you do traditional cardio, your body inevitably targets muscle for fuel. This results in the breakdown of protein into amino acids that can be used for energy during steady-state endurance training.\n\nThis was demonstrated in a <a href=\"http://www.today.com/health/weight-training-better-aerobics-belly-fat-harvard-study-1D80385612\">study</a> that compared a weight-training-only group with a traditional cardio-only group. While the latter lost more weight overall, their waistlines actually expanded!\n\nYes, the group that did traditional aerobics only ended up with a bigger midsection. Why did this happen? <strong>The group lost muscle as a result of the steady-state aerobics and lack of resistance training</strong>.\n\nLess muscle = a slower metabolism.\n\nAnother problem with cardio done the old fashion way is that it deteriorates muscle tissue, reduces the muscle’s ability to absorb glucose after training, and also results in lower testosterone levels.\n\nHIIT, on the other hand, has been shown to do the opposite by elevating growth hormones, as shown in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23310924\">study</a>.\n<h3>Reason #3: HIIT Improves Endurance</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_81245595_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x679.jpg\" alt=\"Side view of running woman\" />\n\nThose who train for performance rather than aesthetics may be more inclined to stick with traditional cardio, believing that this way of training is more suitable for improving lung capacity and long-endurance performance.\n\nThere is no question that regular cardio helps improve overall conditioning; that is undisputable. However, HIIT also improves stamina, so it’s definitely not just for people looking to lose body fat while preserving muscle.\n\nA <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111489\">Plos One study</a> revealed that cardio done for short bursts at high intensity (similar to done in HIIT) elevates mitochondria in the blood, thus <strong>improving body and brain function</strong>.\n\nIf you must do regular cardio for improving endurance for a given sport or other athletic activity, then consider mixing up the training now and then by incorporating HIIT. It’s a great way to keep the workout fresh.\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11772161\">study</a>, in fact, demonstrates that HIIT improves endurance performance among athletes who have reached a plateau training the conventional way.\n\nMost trainers actually have beginners start out with traditional aerobics since it’s less demanding. Once they become physically conditioned, the trainers add high-interval training to the regimen.\n\nHIIT is also beneficial in the endurance department especially if you use exercises that specifically target a certain muscle group frequently used for your given sport.\n\nIf you’re a wrestler or jiu-jitsu practitioner, for instance, then an exercise like the burpee or high vertical jump can be incorporated into HIIT. These movements develop explosive strength, which is needed when executing or defending a takedown.\n<h3>Reason #4: HIIT Is Less Time Consuming</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_51634489_Subscription_Monthly_XL-e1453149692680-1024x673.jpg\" alt=\"Muscular young man holding clock. It is time for workout concept\" />\n\nTraditional cardio is usually done for 30-45 minutes, while HIIT lasts about 15-20 minutes. That’s a 10 to 30 minute difference.\n\nSure, that may not seem like a whole lot, but for those juggling a full work schedule and family commitments, those few extra minutes really go a long way. Shorter workouts also keep you more motivated and helps prevent boredom from kicking in.\n\nIn this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25486273\">study</a>, over half of participants surveyed indicated that they preferred HIIT over more traditional training modalities. This is likely because HIIT often involves multiple exercises, as opposed to regular cardio that involves a single activity done over the entire 30-45 minute duration.\n\nSo, not only is HIIT less time consuming,<strong> but</strong> <strong>it’s also more likely to keep you motivated</strong>. This is a big factor because if you’re lacking motivation, you’ll be more inclined to skip training sessions. This also explains why most fitness-related New Year’s resolutions ultimately fail.\n\nA shorter workout is also beneficial if you perform cardio immediately following strength training. Aside from first thing in the morning, immediately after weight training is the only other optimal window for getting in your cardio.\n<h3>Reason #5: HIIT Decreases Appetite</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/The-10-Commandments-of-Maintaining-Testosterone-Levels-While-Dieting-9-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Strong man holding a bowl of fresh salad on black background\" />\n\nIn the marathon community, there is a phenomenon known as “<em>runger</em>.” This is the feeling of increased hunger after or even during running. <em>Runger</em> has also been known to occur several hours after workout or even the day after.\n\nWhile the condition is often reported among long-distance athletes, recreational runners who do regular cardio have also reported the same experience of an insatiable appetite and a need to immediately raid the fridge following a training session.\n\nWith HIIT, however, there’s evidence to believe that the opposite is true. Studies have shown that a<strong> HIIT workout suppresses the production of ghrelin, a hormone known for stimulating hunger.</strong>\n\nHIIT also reduces cortisol, which is known for increasing appetite and especially a craving for carbs.\n\nRemember,<strong> fat loss isn’t achievable without a calorie deficit</strong>. If you cave into your cravings, then you may have very well nullified the work you just put into your training session.\n\nSince HIIT reduces hunger, you’ll be less inclined to reward yourself with that slice of cheesecake or double-fudge ice cream.\n<h3>Reason #6: HIIT Is Better for the Heart</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_93016912_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Close up of human hands holding human heart\" />\n\nIf long-distance running is good for you, then marathon runners would be the shining examples of men and women in peak health. However, this is far from the case.\n\nHere is the (inconvenient) truth: marathon runners have a disproportionately high rate of heart muscle scarring.\n\nThis was what was found in a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21330616\">study</a> where it was discovered that half of the members of the 100 Marathon Club (exclusive to those who completed 100 or more marathons) showed signs of the condition.\n\nOther studies also showed that endurance athletes had a weakened immune system, excess cortisol levels, and excess inflammation.\n\nGranted, these studies were conducted on athletes who trained for hours on end and kept at it for many years. There's no concrete evidence that traditional cardio done for 30-45 minutes three to four times a week will scar your heart.\n\nIt does, however, raise eyebrows about the validity of steady-state aerobics.\n\nHIIT, on the other hand, has been studied extensively, and the effects on heart health have long been documented. For one, <a href=\"http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/118/4/346.short\">studies</a> show that it <strong>reduces metabolic syndrome, a condition defined by high LDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar levels</strong>. All of these symptoms drastically elevate your risk for heart disease.\n\nWhat’s more, <a href=\"http://cpr.sagepub.com/content/11/3/216.short\">studies</a> have also showed that HIIT training is more effective than traditional cardio in reversing the effects of coronary artery disease.\n\nOn a side note...despite the studies, you still need to consult with your doctor before beginning a HIIT program, or any other workout routine for that matter, if you have a preexisting heart condition. Don’t just dive into a HIIT regimen thinking that it will magically cure you of your ailment.\n<h3>Reason #7: HIIT Is Kinder on the Joints</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_75682478_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Jogging injury.\" />\n\nIf you jog for your cardio exercise, that’s 30-45 minutes of non-stop pounding on the knees. After doing that for many years, you may begin to experience lower joint pain that forces you into the sidelines.\n\nEven alternatives like cycling is known to create knee pain and can lead to a condition known as knee bursitis, which leaves the bone and ligaments in the joint vulnerable to friction.\n\nNow, this isn’t to say that HIIT is an injury-proof workout. Due to the high-pace movement, you are prone to injury if you’re a beginner and your body is not use to the motion. However, once you’re fully eased into the workout, you’re less likely to injure yourself from the overuse of a muscle or joint.\n\nThis is due to the fact that HIIT sessions are shorter. Since HIIT involves different exercises, you are also less likely to subject the joints to a repetitive movement over and over.\n\nOn a side note, you’re just as vulnerable to joint pain from a sedentary lifestyle. There is a condition colloquially known as “<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2235771/Forget-tennis-elbow-suffering-office-knee--desk-jobs-obesity-blame.html\">office knee</a>.” It’s basically the sedentary person’s version of runner’s knee.\n\nThis shows that being a couch potato doesn’t protect you from joint aches. The best prevention is a proven exercise technique like HIIT.\n<h3>Reason #8: HIIT Increases Strength</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_80017691_Subscription_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Bodybuilder holding a weight bar on his shoulders\" />\n\nWhen it comes to muscle preservation and growth, <strong>you have to add strength training to your plan; there is no way around it</strong>. To stimulate growth, though, you have to train to absolute failure. To reach failure, you have to be on your absolute A-game.\n\nThis is yet another reason traditional cardio may not be best. This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22002517\">study</a> from the University of Tampa showed that cardio, when done concurrently with resistance training, <strong>reduced strength output by about 50%.</strong>\n\nHIIT, though,<strong> increases strength and athletic output</strong>, as demonstrated in this <a href=\"http://jap.physiology.org/content/111/6/1540\">study</a>. Exercises done with high intensity and brief rest periods increased overall maximal oxygen intake (VO2 max).\n<h3>Reason #9: HIIT Boosts Brain Power</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_61308095_Subscription_XL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"People trying to concentrate himself\" />\n\nStudies show that cardio of any type improves cognitive function. That, right there, tells you that any form of physical activity does the brain good and is a heck of a lot better than sitting on the couch all day.\n\nCertain workouts, however, boosts mental function more efficiently. A <a href=\"http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/22.06.PMS.118k10w4\">Brazilian study</a> tested subjects’ memories following either HIIT or steady-state cardio. The results revealed that the HIIT group demonstrated <strong>better short-term memory recall and selective attention</strong>.\n\nResearch also shows that exercise increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This is a protein vital for promoting the growth and maturation of neurons.\n\nBDNF production is believed to be proportional to the intensity of the exercise. More intensity equals more BDNF. High BDNF levels are also associated with better moods and sparking creativity.\n<h3>HIIT Has No Equal</h3>\nTraditional cardio certainly has its place. It’s certainly helpful for beginners who need to get their body used to physical activity before turning up the intensity.\n\nBeyond that, HIIT is better in just about every aspect. If it’s results you want, then stick with a method that has scores of scientific backing.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you have never tried a HIIT workout, then NEED to check out my program <a href=\"http://www.directhiit.com\">Direct HIIT</a>. </strong>.</p><p>\nYou’ll have a complete blueprint of how to approach this time-and-tested workout for accelerated fat loss.  Many people eschew HIIT and stick with traditional cardio because it’s less agonizing.\n\nHowever, you have to be willing to go <strong>balls-to-the-wall</strong> if you truly desire for a better body!","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Cardio is often a hotly discussed topic in the fitness niche. Here are the proven reasons why HIIT is superior to traditional cardio.</h3>  \n\n<p>People fall into different categories when it comes to opinion over which style of cardio is best. If you’re currently one of those people who slave away on the treadmill for 30 minutes or longer, then you may want to reconsider the way you train.</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, here are a few ways HIIT beats out old-style cardio.  </p>\n\n<h3>Reason #1: HIIT Burns More Fat</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/Fotolia_27002551_Subscription_Monthly_L-1024x530.jpg\" alt=\"bright flamy symbol on the black background\" /></p>\n\n<p>It’s worth switching over to HIIT for this reason alone. <strong>HIIT is simply more effective at targeting fat stores.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is for the simple reason that it elevates your metabolism for a longer period of time after the workout. This results in more overall calories burned even if you remain mostly sedentary after the exercise.</p>\n\n<p>Even more importantly, a greater percentage of the weight loss comes from body fat. This was proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8028502\">study</a> that compared a 15-week HIIT regimen to a 20-week traditional cardio program.</p>\n\n<p>Subjects in the latter group actually lost 15,000 more calories than the HIIT group. Those that did HIIT, though, lost a greater percentage of body fat.</p>\n\n<p>An <a href=\"http://dc.etsu.edu/etd/123/\">East Tennessee State University study</a> revealed similar results, where subjects that performed HIIT for eight weeks saw a 2% reduction in body fat, compared to zero changes for a traditional cardio group.</p>\n\n<p>Weight loss isn’t just about overall calories burned; the percentages matter.</p>\n\n<p>Losing weight doesn’t necessarily improve your physique. In fact, it can make you look even worse if a greater percentage of the weight loss comes from muscle. This explains why marathon runners often look gaunt with the skinny-fat build.  </p>\n\n<h3>Reason #2: HIIT Preserves Muscle</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_93136803_Subscription_Monthly_L-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Personal fitness trainer holding tape measure isolated over gray background. Closeup of muscular man measuring his waist. Doing perfect six pack abs.\" /></p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest drawbacks of steady-state cardio is the eventual muscle loss.</p>\n\n<p>You will lose some body fat with traditional aerobics, but a bit of muscle will be collateral damage. This can especially be disheartening for men who are trying to lose fat following months of a rigorous bulk-up phase.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Losing muscle that was built on the back of pain, sweat, and dedication can be soul-crushing.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is precisely why cardio should comprise of HIIT. When combined with resistance training and supplementation with a <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">BCAA product</a>, you will hold onto muscle while burning away at your body’s fat stores.</p>\n\n<p>When you do traditional cardio, your body inevitably targets muscle for fuel. This results in the breakdown of protein into amino acids that can be used for energy during steady-state endurance training.</p>\n\n<p>This was demonstrated in a <a href=\"http://www.today.com/health/weight-training-better-aerobics-belly-fat-harvard-study-1D80385612\">study</a> that compared a weight-training-only group with a traditional cardio-only group.

People all over the world have been fasting – both voluntarily and involuntarily – since the dawn of civilization. These days, it’s done primarily for health and weight control.\n\nEven with all the studies verifying the positive effects of intermittent fasting, there are still a lot of myths and half-truths about fasting that just have no basis in reality. Know what these misconceptions are so that you’re well informed before diving right into an intermittent fasting program.\n<h3>Myth #1: Fasting Burns Muscle</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29110008/Fotolia_97493023_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x528.jpg\" alt=\"Bodybuilder athlete lifting weight with fire explode arm concept on background\" />\n\nThis is perhaps one of the greatest concerns regarding fasting especially among men who are also trying to gain muscle weight. Health circles often preach about the importance of eating multiple, smaller meals a day to provide your body a steady supply of calories and nutrients.\n\nIt is through this commonly accepted conventional wisdom that men fear the effects of muscle loss from intermittent fasting. It does, after all, seem to make sense. If you don’t eat for a prolonged period, your body becomes depleted of glycogen, which requires fuel to be acquired from body fat as well as protein from muscle tissue.\n\nIt is true that long-term fasting, upwards of 24 hours or more, may have catabolic effects. However, intermittent fasting usually entails a shorter fasting period, usually 14 to 18 hours. Contrary to popular belief, <strong>intermittent fasting does not result in muscle loss</strong>. This was demonstrated in this <a href=\"http://www.metabolismjournal.com/article/S0026-0495(12)00256-9/abstract\">study</a> where subjects that underwent intermittent fasting every other day for eight weeks lost an average of nine pounds.\n\nHere’s the surprise:<strong> all the weight came from body fat</strong>. The subjects did not lose any non-fat mass even after fasting every other day for two months.\n\nWith that being said, though, fasting may accelerate the rate of muscle loss if you fail to follow a proper diet and exercise plan. Factors like overtraining, drastically reducing calories way too quickly, or doing way too much cardio at a moderate pace may have catabolic consequences.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>This is why a cardio training like HIIT and supplementing with a BCAA supplement like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\">Revolt</a> is highly recommended for preserving muscle mass while losing fat.</strong>.</p><p>\nFasting by itself, however, has no negative consequences on muscle preservation. This is important to note because some muscle heads will have you believe that your muscles will shrink to the size of prunes if you don’t eat every three hours.\n\nWhile frequent small meals certainly have its benefits, it’s not necessary to follow every day. Give your muscles more credit; they won’t deflate because you had a breakfast-less morning.\n<h3>Myth #2: Fasting Will Slow Metabolism</h3>\nThis is one of those half-truths that were discussed earlier. Yes, there’s a grain of truth that fasting slows your metabolism. When your body goes without nourishment, it lowers metabolism as a survival mechanism. This is beneficial as it prolongs survival should you ever find yourself stranded on an island and awaiting rescue.\n\nHowever, this only occurs when you go without food for days on end. One <a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1812308\">study</a>, in fact, showed no metabolic slowdown even when subjects fasted for as long as 72 hours.\n\nWith intermittent fasting, you don’t even fast anywhere near that long, so no need to worry that your metabolism will all of a sudden grind to a standstill.\n\nIt’s understandable that some people would be concerned about this; a lower metabolism, after all, is every dieter’s worst nightmare. The studies, though, prove that the concern is without basis.\n<h3>Myth #3: Skipping Breakfast Will Make You Fat</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29110008/Fotolia_73881998_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x697.jpg\" alt=\"Empty plate on wooden background\" />\n\nSo-called nutritional gurus have drilled it into our heads over and over again that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. There are even studies out there that suggest that skipping the first meal of the day can cause problems like fatigue, poorer concentration, and even weight gain.\n\nHowever, it’s also true that those who routinely skip breakfast (for reasons other than fat loss) tend to have poorer overall lifestyle habits, such as drinking, not watching what they eat, or not exercising.\n\nIn regards to skipping breakfast and weight gain, the correlation has been debunked in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24898236\">study</a> where it was <strong>shown that the decision to eat or skip breakfast had no impact on weight gain.</strong>\n\nIntermittent fasting usually involves skipping the first meal or two of the day and not resuming your regular meals until lunch. This is a good protocol to follow; there is no need to feel obligated to eat breakfast simply because it’s “the most important meal of the day.” This isn’t to vilify breakfast by any means. It’s just to suggest that it’s somewhat overhyped.\n\nIf you tend to get hungry when skipping breakfast, then a glass of water with a few droplets of lemon or lime juice will usually quell hunger. Plus, it also contains some immune-boosting vitamin C.\n<h3>Myth #4: Fasting Raises Cortisol Levels</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29110008/Fotolia_52340552_Subscription_XXL-1024x701.jpg\" alt=\"despair\" />\n\nIt should be made clear that intermittent fasting is not to be confused with a low-calorie diet. Yes, those that fast are also usually eating less overall, but the two are not always mutually exclusive.\n\nThe reason this is important to point out is because low calorie diets has been shown in a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/\">study</a> to raise cortisol levels. This doesn’t mean, though, that fasting has the same consequences.\n\nResearch shows that fasting has no effect on cortisol levels. A <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15452402\">study</a> on Muslims during Ramadan revealed that several days of fasting had no significant changes in their metabolism, hormone, or cortisol levels.\n\nToo much cortisol is the last thing you want when you’re trying to lose fat, and there are plenty of habits that raise this hormone, such as consuming too much soy, stressing out, and not getting enough sleep. Fasting, though, is not one of them.\n<h3>Myth #5: Fasting Gives You Brain Fog</h3>\nHere’s an interesting fact: 20% of the nutrients consumed is used to regulate brain function, despite the fact that brain matter only makes up 2% of the body. Logic would have you believe then, that fasting would make it harder for you to concentrate. People have even reported feeling “zoned out” and unable to focus when going longer than usual without eating.\n\nScience, though, seems to tell a different story. In a <a href=\"http://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2012/summer/dont-feed-your-head\">study</a> conducted at the National Institute on Aging, fasting for twice a week may actually <strong>significantly lower the risk of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer’s.</strong>\n\nIt appears that when you fast, you actually stress the brain to a small degree. Like the muscle, which becomes stronger when stressed from exercise, neurons also appear to become stronger when they’re stressed from lack of energy.\n\nResearch also revealed that fasted mice had higher levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This is a protein that protects neurons and prevents them from dying prematurely. Speaking of BDNF, the protein is also shown to rise during bouts of intense physical activity, which lends further argument for the merits of working out while fasted.\n\nJust be sure to train at a high intensity whether you’re doing HIIT or weight training and – as mentioned already – <strong>take a BCAA supplement like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">Revolt</a> to ensure you don't lose precious lean muscle mass</strong>.\n<h3>Myth #6: Fasting Makes You Overeat</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29110008/Fotolia_92591863_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"fast food and unhealthy eating concept - close up of hamburger or cheeseburger, deep-fried squid rings, french fries, pizza and ketchup on wooden table top view\" />\n\nResearch on this reveals that most people who fast only consume a few more extra hundred calories during their feeding window. One <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461679\">study</a> showed that subjects who fasted for 24 hours only increased their food intake by 500 calories the next day. That’s still fewer calories overall.\n\nThis is where you have to exercise discipline. Yes, you will get hunger pangs while fasting. This is often what causes people to overeat afterwards and to gravitate towards poor food choices. The binging, in a way, is their reward for having gone through an extended period of hunger.\n\nThis is why you have to exercise some level of self-control. Remember that your regular diet resumes after fasting; nothing changes.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>To help you cope with the hunger, take a supplement like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>. This fat burner, in addition to boosting metabolism, also contains ingredients scientifically proven to suppress appetite.</strong>.</p><p>\nAlso keep in mind that the hunger pangs will usually subside once you become accustomed to it. Once your body is used to it, it will just be a mild discomfort that’s fairly tolerable and usually nothing more than the typical feelings of a growling tummy.\n<h3>Myth #7: Training While Fasted Negatively Impacts Physical Performance</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_81397101_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x634.jpg\" alt=\"handsome young man in shorts, doing exercises for biceps, on a dark background in the studio\" />\n\nThe body needs energy, and food is energy. It would seem to make sense then that training fasted diminishes performance. So, is there any grain of truth to this?\n\nWell, it’s kind of a yes and no, but mostly a no. One <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20519256\">study</a> showed that fasting did have a slight negative impact on long-distance aerobics. Even then, researchers believed this was mostly attributed to dehydration, since subjects also refrained from drinking fluids as part of a religious observance.\n\nWhen it comes to research on resistance training, this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19910805\">study</a> showed that <strong>fasting had no noticeable impact on subjects who trains in judo, a sport that requires tremendous explosive strength.</strong>\n\nAs long as you stay hydrated, fasting shouldn’t have any adverse effects on your performance. Of course, every individual is different, and food intake, or lack of it, affects everyone to a different degree. If you feel drained when fasting, then it’s recommended that you use a pre-workout supplement, which often contains caffeine and other ingredients proven to increase athletic performance.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> is one pre-workout that fits this bill perfectly. It has scientifically proven ingredients that can help you get through the toughest workouts.</strong>.</p><p>\n\n<h3>Myth #8: Intermittent Fasting Doesn’t Work as Well for Women</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07110040/Fotolia_76661548_Subscription_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Woman on training apparatus in sports club. Fitness\" />\n\nThere really isn’t any strong evidence suggesting that women get less out of fasting compared to their male counterparts. There is, however, one <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3017674/\">study</a> that shows that overweight women who undergo intermittent calorie restriction (which is similar but not the same as intermittent fasting) reported feeling hungrier and were less inclined to continue the program.\n\nEven in this study, though, the subjects, despite feeling miserable, actually benefited and lost more weight than subjects that followed a typical calorie deficit diet.\n\nIn another <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21410865\">study</a>, women that fasted every other day loss roughly the same amount of body fat but retained more lean muscle compared to a group that followed a regular diet.\n\nIf you’re a woman, you will benefit just as much from fasting as men. There is no solid evidence to suggest that the method is any less effective. The same rules apply, though; this means <strong>staying hydrated during fasting and taking note of any symptoms you may feel.</strong>\n<h3>Myth #9: Intermittent Fasting Works Independently of a Calorie Deficit</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29110008/How-to-Naturally-Maintain-Peak-Testosterone-Levels-After-You-Turn-40-5-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"healthy lifestyle, diet and people concept - close up of male hands with food rich in protein on cutting board on table\" />\n\nPeople who fast normally eat fewer calories overall, but not always. Remember, <strong>weight loss is all about burning more calories than you consume</strong>. If you eat the same amount of calories in spite of fasting, then don’t expect to see significant results.\n\nSure, there are possibly tiny benefits of eating multiple small meals a day, but ultimately, it makes no difference whether 2,000 calories are consumed over six meals or over two meals. 2,000 calories is 2,000 calories. When you fast, your body begins to burn fat for fuel since there is no glycogen in the body to rely on.\n\nFasting also raises your sensitivity to insulin, <strong>which prevents excessive fat stores</strong>. If you neglect cutting calories, then you will gain all the weight back and potentially then some if you overeat during your non-fasting period.\n\nThis is why keeping a food log and counting the calories in every meal is recommended for losing weight\n<h3>Myth #10: Fasting Is a Form of Starving</h3>\nFasting is NOT the same thing as starvation. When you are fasting, your body is depleted of glycogen and burning its reserves (from body fat). When you’re starving, reserves are depleted and the body is turning to muscle tissue for energy.\n\nHere’s another way of putting it: <strong>starvation is fasting taken to an unhealthy extreme</strong>. Some people who severely restrict food intake in a misguided attempt to lose weight, are starving themselves, and that should never be confused with fasting.\n\nAnother difference between the two is the symptoms. With fasting, especially when starting out, you may experience mild symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, and a light headache. <strong>Once you’ve done it for a few weeks, though, the side effects will subside</strong>.\n\nWith starvation, however, the symptoms are far more severe and include muscle waste, cognitive decline, organ failure, and seizures. If you experience such side effects while fasting, then you have crossed over to the territory of starvation. Stop immediately and get some food to your belly. Also be sure to consult with a doctor before continuing.\n<h3>Intermittent Fasting Is a Proven Art</h3>\nFasting, when done responsibly, <strong>has been proven to aid in the fat loss process as well as have lots of health benefits on the side</strong>. Contrary to what some people say, you do not need a steady supply of food every two to three hours.\n\nIf anything, fasting conditions your body to be resilient, and that benefits your mind and well-being just as much as it does your physical body. It’s not always an easy practice, but this is certainly an art where you get what you put into it.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Start implementing intermittent fasting to shred body fat like never before with my <a href=\"http://brolabsmealplan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Meal Plan</a></strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You'll get a unique eating plan designed by me for your specific fitness goals to lose weight, build muscle, and get ripped!.</p><p>\"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">There are still a lot of half-truths about fasting that just have no basis in reality, here are 10 myths about intermittent fasting you need to ignore.</h3>  \n\n<p>Intermittent fasting isn’t a new fad by any stretch of the means.

Of course, every individual is different, and food intake, or lack of it, affects everyone to a different degree. If you feel drained when fasting, then it’s recommended that you use a pre-workout supplement, which often contains caffeine and other ingredients proven to increase athletic performance. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/rebellion?variant=15018905351\" target=\"_blank\">Rebellion</a> is one pre-workout that fits this bill perfectly.

Fitness\" /></p>\n\n<p>There really isn’t any strong evidence suggesting that women get less out of fasting compared to their male counterparts. There is, however, one <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3017674/\">study</a> that shows that overweight women who undergo intermittent calorie restriction (which is similar but not the same as intermittent fasting) reported feeling hungrier and were less inclined to continue the program.</p>\n\n<p>Even in this study, though, the subjects, despite feeling miserable, actually benefited and lost more weight than subjects that followed a typical calorie deficit diet.</p>\n\n<p>In another <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21410865\">study</a>, women that fasted every other day loss roughly the same amount of body fat but retained more lean muscle compared to a group that followed a regular diet.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a woman, you will benefit just as much from fasting as men. There is no solid evidence to suggest that the method is any less effective. The same rules apply, though; this means <strong>staying hydrated during fasting and taking note of any symptoms you may feel.</strong>  </p>\n\n<h3>Myth #9: Intermittent Fasting Works Independently of a Calorie Deficit</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29110008/How-to-Naturally-Maintain-Peak-Testosterone-Levels-After-You-Turn-40-5-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"healthy lifestyle, diet and people concept - close up of male hands with food rich in protein on cutting board on table\" /></p>\n\n<p>People who fast normally eat fewer calories overall, but not always. Remember, <strong>weight loss is all about burning more calories than you consume</strong>. If you eat the same amount of calories in spite of fasting, then don’t expect to see significant results.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, there are possibly tiny benefits of eating multiple small meals a day, but ultimately, it makes no difference whether 2,000 calories are consumed over six meals or over two meals. 2,000 calories is 2,000 calories. When you fast, your body begins to burn fat for fuel since there is no glycogen in the body to rely on.</p>\n\n<p>Fasting also raises your sensitivity to insulin, <strong>which prevents excessive fat stores</strong>. If you neglect cutting calories, then you will gain all the weight back and potentially then some if you overeat during your non-fasting period.</p>\n\n<p>This is why keeping a food log and counting the calories in every meal is recommended for losing weight  </p>\n\n<h3>Myth #10: Fasting Is a Form of Starving</h3>  \n\n<p>Fasting is NOT the same thing as starvation. When you are fasting, your body is depleted of glycogen and burning its reserves (from body fat). When you’re starving, reserves are depleted and the body is turning to muscle tissue for energy.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s another way of putting it: <strong>starvation is fasting taken to an unhealthy extreme</strong>. Some people who severely restrict food intake in a misguided attempt to lose weight, are starving themselves, and that should never be confused with fasting.</p>\n\n<p>Another difference between the two is the symptoms. With fasting, especially when starting out, you may experience mild symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, and a light headache. <strong>Once you’ve done it for a few weeks, though, the side effects will subside</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>With starvation, however, the symptoms are far more severe and include muscle waste, cognitive decline, organ failure, and seizures. If you experience such side effects while fasting, then you have crossed over to the territory of starvation. Stop immediately and get some food to your belly. Also be sure to consult with a doctor before continuing.  </p>\n\n<h3>Intermittent Fasting Is a Proven Art</h3>  \n\n<p>Fasting, when done responsibly, <strong>has been proven to aid in the fat loss process as well as have lots of health benefits on the side</strong>. Contrary to what some people say, you do not need a steady supply of food every two to three hours.</p>\n\n<p>If anything, fasting conditions your body to be resilient, and that benefits your mind and well-being just as much as it does your physical body. It’s not always an easy practice, but this is certainly an art where you get what you put into it. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Start implementing intermittent fasting to shred body fat like never before with my <a href=\"http://brolabsmealplan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Meal Plan</a></strong>.</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You'll get a unique eating plan designed by me for your specific fitness goals to lose weight, build muscle, and get ripped!.</p><p>\"</p>","amp":null,"image":"//media.brandoncarter.com/2009/12/befor-and-after.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-01-29 11:00:08","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-01-29 11:00:08","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-01-29 11:00:08","published_by":1},{"id":2310,"uuid":"e45e5d91-77c2-4642-b49a-5bbfded692b4","title":"11 Crazy Powerful Effects of Intermittent Fasting","slug":"11-crazy-powerful-effects-of-intermittent-fasting","markdown":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Intermittent fasting is being recognized more and more for its fat-burning, health promoting properties. Here are some of the powerful effects of fasting</h3>\nFood is essential for sustaining life and providing our bodies with valuable vitamins and minerals. This doesn’t mean, however, that we need a constant supply of it every three or so hours.\n\nThe human body is so much more resilient and won’t malfunction all of a sudden because you skipped a meal or two. <strong>Fasting, in fact, is actually quite healthy and will benefit your body in more ways than one</strong>; if done right, it may just help you achieve a lean and mean physique.\n\nIf you’re still on the fences about intermittent fasting, then here are 11 ways that fasting benefits the body, mind, and soul.\n<h3>Benefit #1: Fasting Helps You Burn Fat</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110032/Fotolia_74306945_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x680.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup of shirtless Caucasian man in blue jeans measuring his lean muscular thirty inch waist with tape meaure on gray background\" />\n\nFasting doesn’t just help you lose weight,<strong> it helps you burn fat</strong>. That’s provided, of course, that you do it the right way. How does it do this? Generally, when you fast, you are also consuming fewer calories since you are having fewer meals. A calorie deficit, as you may know, is absolutely necessary for weight loss.\n\nAlso, by fasting, you are depleting your body of blood sugar (glycogen). With depleted glycogen stores, your body turns to fat stores for energy. On top of that, fasting is also believed to increase adipose tissue hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). This is an enzyme believed to be responsible for releasing fat from adipose (fat) cells in order to be burned as energy.\n\nFasting also increases production of muscle tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL), another enzyme that shuttles the released fat into muscle cells where it’s expended as fuel.\n\nAs mentioned, most of the weight you lose from fasting will be from fat. Many people are on the fences about fasting due to the mainstream belief that going for prolonged periods without food also burns muscle. This is only true if your fasting lasts for days on end.\n\nIf taken to such extremes, then you are starving yourself, not fasting. Intermittent fasting, which usually lasts for about 16 hours, <strong>has in fact been shown in studies to amplify the secretion of growth hormones</strong>. In the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC329619/?page=6\">study</a>, non-obese men who underwent fasting saw an average testosterone increase of 180%!\n\nTo further ensure muscle preservation, it’s also recommended that you maintain a resistance training regimen and exercise during a fasted state while supplementing with a BCAA supplement like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\">Revolt</a>.\n<h3>Benefit #2: Intermittent Fasting Does the Brain Good</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110032/Fotolia_55237023_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x647.jpg\" alt=\"Young girl thinking with glowing brain illustration on grungy background\" />\n\nYes, it’s true that the brain needs nourishment just as much as the rest of the body. However, this doesn’t mean you need six meals a day to keep the brain functioning optimally. <strong>In fact, temporary food deprivation may actually boost cognitive function</strong>.\n\nThis was proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670843/\">study</a> where mice deprived of food for a short period outperformed a control group in various cognitive tasks. Some college students are now even known to fast in the days before a major exam because it helps them maintain their focus.\n\nYou see, the brain is very much like muscle in the sense that it gets stronger when placed under stress. Muscles grow when stressed from heavy resistance training. Likewise, the brain becomes stronger and produces new neural cells when mildly stressed from the lack of food intake.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11220789\">Studies</a> show that fasting raises levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF). A deficiency in BDNF has been linked to brain problems, such as depression and memory loss.\n<h3>Benefit #3: Intermittent Fasting Promotes Healthy Eating Habits</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110032/Fotolia_62091684_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Shaped and healthy body man holding a fresh salad bowl,shaped abdominal, isolated on white background, colored retouched\" />Fasting has been known to help people who struggle with compulsive and binge eating disorders. More importantly, it helps the body relearn what true hunger is. If you eat every three hours day in and out, your body forgets what it feels like to be truly hungry. This is not good.\n\nWhy is it a good thing to ignore a growling stomach? The feeling of hunger triggers the body to regulate and release the right balance of hormones, particularly those that regulate appetite.\n\nThose who are obese often develop excessive eating patterns and binge indiscriminately because their bodies no longer receive the signals that tell them they’re full. This is due to their hormone levels being out of whack, caused by the constant intake of food. <strong>By fasting, you allow your body to “reset” its cycle back to default.</strong>\n\nBeing hungry isn’t a pleasant sensation, but it’s worth letting your body go through the feeling every now and then to help restore hormone regulation and bodily rhythms that may be out of balance.\n<h3>Benefit #4: Intermittent Fasting Cleanses the Body</h3>\nSupplement manufacturers these days release all sorts of detox supplements that supposedly flush harmful toxins that have built up in your body as a result of years of poor dietary choices. Why waste your money on pricey supplements that may not even work when you can get the same benefits through an intermittent fast that costs you nothing?\n\nThe body expends a great deal of energy on digestion. When you eat six meals a day on a daily basis, that is a lot of energy used that could have been used elsewhere. When you fast, your body suddenly has additional energy since it no longer has to work overtime to convert that cheeseburger you ate into usable energy. Your body now has energy for functions that normally take a back seat, such as removing waste and toxins.\n\nMany people actually report feeling “lighter” and refreshed after several weeks of fasting two to four times a week. This is due to the removal of bodily impurities that cause fatigue, lethargy, and memory fog.\n\nIt’s important to note, however, that fasting taken to the extreme can actually have the opposite effect and inhibit the body’s ability to excrete waste. Much of the detoxification process is carried out by good bacteria in the colon and the mucus membranes that line the colon wall and prevent discarded waste from reentering the bloodstream and muscle tissue.\n\nWhen you go beyond an intermittent fast and go without food for consecutive days, you seriously deprive your body of vitamins and minerals needed for healthy colon function.\n<h3>Benefit #5: Intermittent Fasting Increases Libido</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110032/IMG_9014-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9014\" />\n\nSome men have especially reported an increase in sex drive when undergoing a fast. Blood plays a large role in digestion, and when there’s no food to digest, the blood is relieved from that duty, thus freeing it for other functions.\n\nAs discussed, <strong>intermittent fasting also increases testosterone</strong>. Elevated T production has been linked to an increased sperm count and sperm motility. Testosterone replacement therapy, in fact, is often prescribed for men experiencing low libido or having trouble performing in the bedroom.\n\nIn this respects, intermittent fasting has an indirect, positive effect in maintaining heightened sexual desires and interest.\n\nNow, this isn’t to say that fasting will transform you into a sex monster. It does, however, suggest a correlation between fasting and sex drive that should not be ignored, and it definitely warrants further studies.\n<h3>Benefit #6: Intermittent Fasting Promotes Healthy Sleep Cycles</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110032/How-to-Naturally-Maintain-Peak-Testosterone-Levels-After-You-Turn-40-8-e1453750357322-1024x600.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of fit male model asleep in luxurious bedroom bathed in bright warm morning window light\" />\n\nThis <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12748412\">study</a> showed that not only does intermittent fasting <strong>improve sleep quality but also improved concentration and alertness during waking hours</strong>. Some people who fast also report sleeping less without feeling the usual daytime fatigue the day after.\n\nIt’s also believed that fasting may help individuals combat the effects of jet lag. Researchers from Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois devised what is now known as the Argonne Anti-Jet-Lag diet. It’s a well-known fact that sleep cycles are determined in part, by exposure to natural sunlight.\n\nWell, researchers from the study theorized that sleep is also partially regulated by the frequency and timing of food intake.\n\nIn their <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2009/05/a-fast-solution-to-jet-lag.html\">study</a>, the team discovered that U.S. National Guard troops that fasted the week before a trip from their home base in Chicago to Korea were 7.5 times less likely to experience jet lag compared to a control group. The troops followed the same routine a week before their return trip home and were 16.2 times less likely than the control to experience sleep disturbances.\n\nThe diet has become so popular that it has now been used by other members of the US Military as well as the CIA and the Canadian National Swim Team just to list a few.\n\nThe study has also since been updated. Apparently, you can experience the same benefits by simply fasting for 16 hours before your first meal at the new time zone.\n\nIf you’re a frequent traveler, then definitely consider fasting as a tool for quickly acclimating yourself to the new time zone.\n<h3>Benefit #7: Intermittent Fasting Is a Heart-Healthy Practice</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_93016912_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Close up of human hands holding human heart\" />\n\nA lot of foods have been touted as being good for the heart, such as whole wheat, fish, and various fruits and vegetables. However, no food at all may be just as heart-healthy as intermittent fasting.\n\nA <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110403090259.htm\">study</a> from the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute revealed that fasting lowered the risk of coronary disease as well as lowering blood cholesterol levels and decreasing the risk for type II diabetes. Similar <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/regular-fasting-may-boost-heart-health/?_r=0\">studies</a> yielded near identical results, showing that those who regularly fasted were 58% less likely to be diagnosed with heart disease.\n\nWhile the correlation isn’t completely understood, it’s believed that fasting stresses the body. The body responds to the stress by activating protective mechanisms, such as releasing growth hormones, that may have beneficial long-term effects on cardiovascular health.\n\nConsidering that heart disease is the leading cause of death among men and women in America, this is all the more reason to incorporate intermittent fasting as part of a healthy lifestyle. The other part includes making sound food choices, such as whole fruits and vegetables, while limiting sugary and refined treats to your cheat day.\n<h3>Benefit #8: Intermittent Fasting May Help You Overcome Harmful Addictions</h3>\nAddiction to alcohol or smoking is not exactly something that you can just quit cold turkey. The withdrawal symptoms are often too powerful and makes you a prisoner in your own body.\n\nOf course, there are all sorts of methods and techniques, such as 12-steps programs and hypnosis for overcoming addictions. Unbeknownst to most people, fasting may also be a helpful trick for alleviating the grasp of withdrawal symptoms.\n\nHere’s why it works: the body has a natural register of what it perceives as pleasurable and what it perceives as repugnant.\n\nTake smoking, for instance; smoking for the first time feels repugnant to your senses. If you continue to light up, however, the body not only becomes used to it, but it begins to sense cigarette smoking as pleasurable to the point where your body constantly craves for it, hence the addiction-forming habit.\n\nIt’s believed that fasting helps restore your sensory register back to normal. This means that, within a few days of fasting, smoking begins to feel distasteful again just as it was the first time you lit up.\n\n<strong>Fasting can be a powerful tool for overcoming most addictions, such as alcohol, recreational drugs, or junk food</strong>. Fasting alone, though, may or may not help you completely overcome your addiction depending on level of severity. In any case, treat it as a supplement to the 12-step program or whatever method you’re using to counteract the insatiable cravings.\n<h3>Benefit #9: Intermittent Fasting May Alleviate Arthritis Pain</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_75682478_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Jogging injury.\" />\n\nIn one <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/534318?dopt=Abstract\">study</a>, rheumatoid arthritis patients that underwent a fasting program reported some degree of relief and were able to get by without their routine use of pain medication.\n\nThe same study also studied the effects of a vegetarian diet on arthritis. After a meat-free diet for nine weeks, subjects reported no difference in their pain and discomfort levels.\n\nClearly, there is a link between fasting and pain relief, though the connection is not completely understood at this point. It’s certainly worth a try if you’re no longer a young stallion and are beginning to feel your joints stiffen and ache.\n<h3>Benefit #10: Intermittent Fasting Prolongs Your Life</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_66039837_Subscription_XL-1024x644.jpg\" alt=\"Asian businessman trying to turn back time by pulling on a rope attached to the hands of a clock.\" />\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the U.S. is ranked number 34 when it comes to life expectancy. That’s not so bad considering that it’s out of 198 countries. However, there’s no doubt that the U.S.’ ranking would be so much higher if it wasn’t for the typical western diet.\n\nIf you want to live a longer and hearty life beyond the average life expectancy,<strong> then intermittent fasting just might tack on a few years to your life</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10878625/Fasting-for-three-days-can-regenerate-entire-immune-system-study-finds.html\">Studies</a> have shown that fasting can completely regenerate the immune system by depleting old white blood cells and producing new ones.\n\nSome doctors are even recommending fasting for people whose immune systems have been weakened from illness or chemotherapy.\n\nIn another <a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/295647.php\">study</a>, human subjects that fasted for just five days out of the month for three months saw a vast improvement in their health, <strong>including lowered blood glucose, reduced inflammation, reduced oxidative damage, and reduction in risk factors associated with aging.</strong>\n\nThe U.S. population has an average life expectancy of 79-years. If you could add a few extra years to that by fasting, then isn’t it worth the occasional hunger pang?\n<h3>Benefit #11: Intermittent Fasting Promotes Spiritual Well-Being</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110032/Fotolia_92075077_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x685.jpg\" alt=\"Zen tower horizontal left\" />\n\nYou may or may not be a spiritual or religious person. Even if you’re not, <strong>fasting has been shown to promote a sense of inner well-being</strong> that you can certainly appreciate.\n\nFasting is a part of many religious practices. In some customs, it’s believed that fasting helps you connect with the spirit world. Others believe that it balances your chakras, while others believe it activates your third eye, leaving you open to spiritual insights and enlightenment.\n\nOf course, all of this is beyond science, so none of it can be proven. Many people, though, have reported more profound experiences during meditation, prayer, yoga practice, or greater body/spirit connection after having fasted.\n<h3>Fasting Is a Proven Science</h3>\nFasting is incredibly powerful for fat loss. You will certainly shed the flab if fasting is done correctly, but you will also reap so much more out of it.\n\nContrary to popular belief, you don’t need a whole lot of food to stay nourished and replenished. Going for a few hours more than usual without food has been validated to do the body all sorts of good. It just may be the closest thing there is to a fountain of youth, so don’t you owe it to yourself to at least consider it as a legitimate practice?\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you want to get the maximal benefits from intermittent fasting, then you should couple fasting with <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>.

When you eat six meals a day on a daily basis, that is a lot of energy used that could have been used elsewhere. When you fast, your body suddenly has additional energy since it no longer has to work overtime to convert that cheeseburger you ate into usable energy. Your body now has energy for functions that normally take a back seat, such as removing waste and toxins.</p>\n\n<p>Many people actually report feeling “lighter” and refreshed after several weeks of fasting two to four times a week. This is due to the removal of bodily impurities that cause fatigue, lethargy, and memory fog.</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to note, however, that fasting taken to the extreme can actually have the opposite effect and inhibit the body’s ability to excrete waste. Much of the detoxification process is carried out by good bacteria in the colon and the mucus membranes that line the colon wall and prevent discarded waste from reentering the bloodstream and muscle tissue.</p>\n\n<p>When you go beyond an intermittent fast and go without food for consecutive days, you seriously deprive your body of vitamins and minerals needed for healthy colon function.  </p>\n\n<h3>Benefit #5: Intermittent Fasting Increases Libido</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110032/IMG_9014-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9014\" /></p>\n\n<p>Some men have especially reported an increase in sex drive when undergoing a fast. Blood plays a large role in digestion, and when there’s no food to digest, the blood is relieved from that duty, thus freeing it for other functions.</p>\n\n<p>As discussed, <strong>intermittent fasting also increases testosterone</strong>. Elevated T production has been linked to an increased sperm count and sperm motility. Testosterone replacement therapy, in fact, is often prescribed for men experiencing low libido or having trouble performing in the bedroom.</p>\n\n<p>In this respects, intermittent fasting has an indirect, positive effect in maintaining heightened sexual desires and interest.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this isn’t to say that fasting will transform you into a sex monster. It does, however, suggest a correlation between fasting and sex drive that should not be ignored, and it definitely warrants further studies.  </p>\n\n<h3>Benefit #6: Intermittent Fasting Promotes Healthy Sleep Cycles</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110032/How-to-Naturally-Maintain-Peak-Testosterone-Levels-After-You-Turn-40-8-e1453750357322-1024x600.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of fit male model asleep in luxurious bedroom bathed in bright warm morning window light\" /></p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12748412\">study</a> showed that not only does intermittent fasting <strong>improve sleep quality but also improved concentration and alertness during waking hours</strong>. Some people who fast also report sleeping less without feeling the usual daytime fatigue the day after.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also believed that fasting may help individuals combat the effects of jet lag. Researchers from Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois devised what is now known as the Argonne Anti-Jet-Lag diet. It’s a well-known fact that sleep cycles are determined in part, by exposure to natural sunlight.</p>\n\n<p>Well, researchers from the study theorized that sleep is also partially regulated by the frequency and timing of food intake.</p>\n\n<p>In their <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2009/05/a-fast-solution-to-jet-lag.html\">study</a>, the team discovered that U.S. National Guard troops that fasted the week before a trip from their home base in Chicago to Korea were 7.5 times less likely to experience jet lag compared to a control group. The troops followed the same routine a week before their return trip home and were 16.2 times less likely than the control to experience sleep disturbances.</p>\n\n<p>The diet has become so popular that it has now been used by other members of the US Military as well as the CIA and the Canadian National Swim Team just to list a few.</p>\n\n<p>The study has also since been updated. Apparently, you can experience the same benefits by simply fasting for 16 hours before your first meal at the new time zone.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a frequent traveler, then definitely consider fasting as a tool for quickly acclimating yourself to the new time zone.  </p>\n\n<h3>Benefit #7: Intermittent Fasting Is a Heart-Healthy Practice</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_93016912_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Close up of human hands holding human heart\" /></p>\n\n<p>A lot of foods have been touted as being good for the heart, such as whole wheat, fish, and various fruits and vegetables. However, no food at all may be just as heart-healthy as intermittent fasting.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110403090259.htm\">study</a> from the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute revealed that fasting lowered the risk of coronary disease as well as lowering blood cholesterol levels and decreasing the risk for type II diabetes. Similar <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/regular-fasting-may-boost-heart-health/?_r=0\">studies</a> yielded near identical results, showing that those who regularly fasted were 58% less likely to be diagnosed with heart disease.</p>\n\n<p>While the correlation isn’t completely understood, it’s believed that fasting stresses the body. The body responds to the stress by activating protective mechanisms, such as releasing growth hormones, that may have beneficial long-term effects on cardiovascular health.</p>\n\n<p>Considering that heart disease is the leading cause of death among men and women in America, this is all the more reason to incorporate intermittent fasting as part of a healthy lifestyle. The other part includes making sound food choices, such as whole fruits and vegetables, while limiting sugary and refined treats to your cheat day.  </p>\n\n<h3>Benefit #8: Intermittent Fasting May Help You Overcome Harmful Addictions</h3>  \n\n<p>Addiction to alcohol or smoking is not exactly something that you can just quit cold turkey. The withdrawal symptoms are often too powerful and makes you a prisoner in your own body.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are all sorts of methods and techniques, such as 12-steps programs and hypnosis for overcoming addictions. Unbeknownst to most people, fasting may also be a helpful trick for alleviating the grasp of withdrawal symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s why it works: the body has a natural register of what it perceives as pleasurable and what it perceives as repugnant.</p>\n\n<p>Take smoking, for instance; smoking for the first time feels repugnant to your senses. If you continue to light up, however, the body not only becomes used to it, but it begins to sense cigarette smoking as pleasurable to the point where your body constantly craves for it, hence the addiction-forming habit.</p>\n\n<p>It’s believed that fasting helps restore your sensory register back to normal. This means that, within a few days of fasting, smoking begins to feel distasteful again just as it was the first time you lit up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fasting can be a powerful tool for overcoming most addictions, such as alcohol, recreational drugs, or junk food</strong>. Fasting alone, though, may or may not help you completely overcome your addiction depending on level of severity. In any case, treat it as a supplement to the 12-step program or whatever method you’re using to counteract the insatiable cravings.  </p>\n\n<h3>Benefit #9: Intermittent Fasting May Alleviate Arthritis Pain</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_75682478_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Jogging injury.\" /></p>\n\n<p>In one <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/534318?dopt=Abstract\">study</a>, rheumatoid arthritis patients that underwent a fasting program reported some degree of relief and were able to get by without their routine use of pain medication.</p>\n\n<p>The same study also studied the effects of a vegetarian diet on arthritis. After a meat-free diet for nine weeks, subjects reported no difference in their pain and discomfort levels.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, there is a link between fasting and pain relief, though the connection is not completely understood at this point. It’s certainly worth a try if you’re no longer a young stallion and are beginning to feel your joints stiffen and ache.  </p>\n\n<h3>Benefit #10: Intermittent Fasting Prolongs Your Life</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/30110029/Fotolia_66039837_Subscription_XL-1024x644.jpg\" alt=\"Asian businessman trying to turn back time by pulling on a rope attached to the hands of a clock.\" /></p>\n\n<p>According to the World Health Organization, the U.S. is ranked number 34 when it comes to life expectancy. That’s not so bad considering that it’s out of 198 countries. However, there’s no doubt that the U.S.’ ranking would be so much higher if it wasn’t for the typical western diet.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to live a longer and hearty life beyond the average life expectancy,<strong> then intermittent fasting just might tack on a few years to your life</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10878625/Fasting-for-three-days-can-regenerate-entire-immune-system-study-finds.html\">Studies</a> have shown that fasting can completely regenerate the immune system by depleting old white blood cells and producing new ones.</p>\n\n<p>Some doctors are even recommending fasting for people whose immune systems have been weakened from illness or chemotherapy.</p>\n\n<p>In another <a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/295647.php\">study</a>, human subjects that fasted for just five days out of the month for three months saw a vast improvement in their health, <strong>including lowered blood glucose, reduced inflammation, reduced oxidative damage, and reduction in risk factors associated with aging.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The U.S. population has an average life expectancy of 79-years. If you could add a few extra years to that by fasting, then isn’t it worth the occasional hunger pang?  </p>\n\n<h3>Benefit #11: Intermittent Fasting Promotes Spiritual Well-Being</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110032/Fotolia_92075077_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x685.jpg\" alt=\"Zen tower horizontal left\" /></p>\n\n<p>You may or may not be a spiritual or religious person. Even if you’re not, <strong>fasting has been shown to promote a sense of inner well-being</strong> that you can certainly appreciate.</p>\n\n<p>Fasting is a part of many religious practices. In some customs, it’s believed that fasting helps you connect with the spirit world. Others believe that it balances your chakras, while others believe it activates your third eye, leaving you open to spiritual insights and enlightenment.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, all of this is beyond science, so none of it can be proven. Many people, though, have reported more profound experiences during meditation, prayer, yoga practice, or greater body/spirit connection after having fasted.  </p>\n\n<h3>Fasting Is a Proven Science</h3>  \n\n<p>Fasting is incredibly powerful for fat loss. You will certainly shed the flab if fasting is done correctly, but you will also reap so much more out of it.</p>\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need a whole lot of food to stay nourished and replenished. Going for a few hours more than usual without food has been validated to do the body all sorts of good. It just may be the closest thing there is to a fountain of youth, so don’t you owe it to yourself to at least consider it as a legitimate practice? <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you want to get the maximal benefits from intermittent fasting, then you should couple fasting with <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a>.

Even lots of foods today, not to mention energy drinks and herbal extracts come in a ginseng flavor.\n\nDespite its popularity, very few people know about ginseng's proven benefits. Sure, many people instantly recognize the flavor, but hardly anyone takes the time to learn why ginseng is such a revered health tonic in most Asian countries.\n<h3>All About Ginseng and Its Benefits</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20213342/Korean-Ginseng-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThere are 11 known varieties of ginseng, though the qualities and nutritional value are more or less similar, so no need to discuss each variety at length and turn this post into a research paper.\n\nThe two most common varieties are Korean and American ginseng, though even between these two, the nutritional makeup isn’t really that different.\n\nSome herbalists may prescribe a certain variety to treat a specific illness, though for the general benefits that will be discussed, there is no need to lose sleep over which variety is best or superior above all others.\n\nBut enough about that, let's get into the actual benefits of supplementing with ginseng!\n<h3>Ginseng for Weight Loss</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26110046/Fotolia_61928921_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Weight loss concept\" />\n\nSince you're following my stuff, I assume that you’re striving for a better body.

Here is everything you need to know about intermittent fasting.</h3>\nThere seems to be new diet fads left and right, many of which contradict one another. Intermittent fasting is definitely NOT one of those diets.\n\nYes It certainly challenges the conventional wisdom of eating six or more meals a day, but more and more scientific evidence are supporting the benefits of intermittent fasting, and people who practice it responsibly have sworn by it.\n\nIf all the previous diets you have tried have only yielded mediocre results, then this diet just may be right for you.\n<h3>Intermittent Fasting 101</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25110046/Fasting-101.png\" alt=\"Fasting 101\" />\n\nFasting, of course, entails going for a specific length of time without eating, or eating only small morsel of foods with very few calories, such as vegetables.\n\nPeople fast for a variety of reasons, and it’s not always voluntarily. In many underdeveloped nations where famine is rampant, people will fast for days when crops yielded little. What little food was available was given to their children so their offspring wouldn't go hungry.\n\nPeople also fast for religious observances. In the Muslim holiday Ramadan, followers refrain from eating or drinking while remaining in steadfast prayer and avoiding impure thoughts.\n\nToday, many more people fast for health reasons, <strong>including accelerating fat loss and flushing the body of harmful toxins.</strong>\n\nEven in the animal kingdom, various forms of wildlife fast on a routine daily basis. Since animals have to stalk prey to bring food to the dinner table, an unsuccessful hunt meant going for weeks without food.\n\nUnlike humans, they do not have the convenience of dropping by a grocery store and exchanging paper currency for a rack of lamb.\n\nThe fasting duration varies in length and can range anywhere from half a day to as long as the body is physically able to survive without eating. The extreme end of the spectrum, though, is very dangerous and is almost never recommended by health professionals, or the reputable ones at least.\n\nWith intermittent fasting, the duration is on the lower end and typically never more than 24 hours, and in most cases, much shorter at around 14 to 18 hours.\n\nHere’s another point about fasting: everyone fasts whether they know it or not. When you wake up every morning, you just fasted for at least eight hours. That’s definitely a lot longer than you normally go between meals during your waking hours.\n\nWith intermittent fasting, you’re just adding a few more hours on top of that.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3-iocPJNJig?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>How to Fast</h3>\nOkay, so you’re sold on the idea of intermittent fasting. How do you go about doing it? The process is quite simple to follow and usually lasts for 16 hours, give or take an hour or two.\n\nThe best part of all, half of the process is already completed for you since – as already mentioned – you fast every night during slumber. If you are getting the recommended eight hours of sleep, then you only need to get in another eight hours.\n\nThe best way to get that in is by eating your last meal of the day a little earlier than usual and skipping breakfast the next morning. This should add up to 16 hours by the time lunch comes around. Here is a sample schedule of what this would look like:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Final meal of the day</td>\n<td width=\"319\">8:00 pm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Bedtime</td>\n<td width=\"319\">12:00 am</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Bed rise</td>\n<td width=\"319\">8:00 am</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\">Lunch</td>\n<td width=\"319\">12:00 pm</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThe chart shows an entire 16 hour time frame. For some people, adhering to such a routine is as simple as skipping breakfast.\n\nIf you choose to, you may extend the fast by an additional hour or two by having the last meal of the day even earlier or pushing lunch back by an hour or so.\n<h3>How to Fight the Hunger</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25110046/The-Alpha-Male-Guide-to-Testosterone-and-Dominance-7-1024x719.jpg\" alt=\"Thumbs up for healthy diet\" />\n\nWhen you go for longer than usual without eating, hunger is going to set in. Everyone has a different hunger threshold. Some people find it unbearable while for others it’s nothing more than a mild discomfort that’s more than tolerable.\n\nIn any case, it’s all mind over matter. Nevertheless, if you’re not accustomed to fasting, it can get quite uncomfortable. There are ways to help you cope so that your mind isn’t inundated with thoughts of food all day.\n\nOne method is to take an appetite suppressing supplement. Some fat burners come with ingredients known for minimizing hunger. <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a> is one example; it contains <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/rejuvenate-body-proven-power-green-tea-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">green tea</a>, which contains catecholamine, a compound proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17907825\">study</a> for reducing appetite.\n\nCoffee has also been shown to blunt appetite. Bro Labs <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/fighter-fuel?variant=14954915207\" target=\"_blank\">Fighter Fuel</a> coffee is a delicious and healthy coffee product that can help you fight off hunger.\n\nAnother way to cope is to consume fibrous, crunchy vegetables. Sure, there are a few calories in vegetables, so technically, you’re breaking your fast, but the amount is negligible.\n\nYet another way to combat hunger is by keeping yourself busy. According to some psychologists, <strong>some people eat as a way of fighting off boredom, and may confuse boredom for hunger</strong>.\n\nFor many people, whether they realize it or not, eating is a form of entertainment. Keeping yourself busy with work, house errands, or any other productive activity prevents you from gravitating towards the fridge or daydreaming about a cheeseburger.\n\nAlso know that you can ease into fasting gradually. Instead of a 16-hour fast, consider 14 hours or even 12. Pay attention to your body and notice how it feels.\n\nObviously, there will be hunger; take note of any other bodily sensations and go from there. If it feels manageable, then proceed with a 16-hour fast. If the hunger is making you too uncomfortable, then take the next few weeks to work your way up to that duration.\n<h3>Be Sure to Stay Hydrated</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25110046/Fotolia_84607707_Subscription_XL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of a athletic young man holding a water bottle, isolated over a gray background\" />\n\nRemember, fasting is about refraining from food, not fluids.. You can survive for about three weeks without food but only about three days without water, <strong>so drink up even if you only plan for a 16-hour fast.</strong>\n\nAside from keeping you nicely hydrated, people who drank more water has also been shown in <a href=\"http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2010/august/clinical-trial-confirms-effectiveness-of-simple-appetite-control-method.html\">studies</a> to consume fewer calories overall, so good ol’ H2O certainly appears to have some appetite suppression qualities.\n\nIntermittent fasting, in fact, has also been referred to as water fasting since that’s all you’re consuming the entire duration.\n\nIf the bland taste of water makes drinking a chore, then add some flavor by squeezing a few drops of lemon or lime juice. You can even substitute water for herbal tea or even <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/fighter-fuel?variant=14954915207\" target=\"_blank\">pure black coffee</a> minus the cream and sugar. These are all healthy beverages that contain antioxidants without the calories, or merely minuscule amounts.\n\nSome people also drink sparkling water, attesting that carbonated beverages are actually quite helpful for quelling appetite. It’s best that you stick to natural drinks since diet soda is filled with artificial sweeteners and colors. Fountain drinks, diet or not, are something that’s best saved for your cheat day.\n<h3>Any Side Effects?</h3>\nIntermittent fasting is generally safe, though some people do experience some mild side effects besides hunger. This may include dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and nausea. A few people also reported feeling irritable and like they can lose their temper at any moment.\n\n<strong>All symptoms should subside within a week or so once your body adjusts</strong>. Side effects for the most part should be fairly mild. If it feels severe and you’re beginning to feel physically ill, then stop immediately. You may want to see your doctor before continuing in the future.\n\nAlso be mindful that you definitely need to see a doctor before fasting if you have any preexisting medical conditions like diabetes.\n<h3>A Note About Calories</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25110046/Fotolia_68329552_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Nutrition facts\" />\n\nIf you’re fasting for fat loss, know that the method alone will not help you burn off the pounds if it’s not accompanied by a calorie deficit. <strong>You still need to consume fewer calories overall</strong>. Some people consume unnecessarily large portions of food in their first meal after a fast. This almost negates the purpose and benefits.\n\nLook, it’s understandable; you haven’t eaten anything for 16 hours, and your stomach is demanding food. You’re more hungry than usual, and the very presence of food has you salivating.\n\nThere will be temptation, but that’s where you need to exercise discipline. Don’t throw away everything you just worked for to satisfy a temporary craving.\n\nBy the same token, you should also be careful not to overeat in your final meal before beginning a fast. Some people eat a large meal believing that it will hold off hunger longer during their prolonged period of no food. This is just as counterproductive.\n\nIf you’re on a fat loss phase, then you should be counting calories. You should not be exceeding your established daily limit. When you come off a fast, you can’t all of a sudden reward yourself with an extra cheat day. You still need to consume clean foods and stay within your calorie count.\n\nMacronutrient ratios still continue to matter as well. That means getting plenty of protein with moderate carbs and fat intake. Fasting doesn’t change any of this or give you any extra leeway.\n<h3>How Often to Fast</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_51634489_Subscription_Monthly_XL-e1453149692680-1024x673.jpg\" alt=\"Muscular young man holding clock. It is time for workout concept\" />\n\nThere’s no set rule on how often you should fast. It depends largely on your own individual goals. For fat loss, try to have a fast day at least twice a week. You can also do three times a week or even every other day.\n\nIt’s even recommended that you fast if you’re smack in the middle of a muscle, or “bulk up” phase. Fasting once to twice a week when you’re trying to build muscle may offset some fat gain.\n\nKeep in mind, though, just as you need to maintain a calorie deficit while losing weight, you need to add calories while gaining lean mass. With that in mind, be sure you’re not cutting too many calories on your fast day.\n\nIf you choose to go on a longer fast or even a full 24 hours, then limit the fasting days to no more than twice a week.\n\nIf you rotate between muscle building and fat loss phases, and want to incorporate intermittent fasting into your regimen, then consider a <a href=\"http://Brolabsmealplan.com\">customized meal plan</a> to take the guesswork out of food selection, ratios, and meal timing.\n<h3>Why Fasting Works</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_80046624_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"successful weight loss, white background, diet concept\" />\n\nSo why does fasting work so well? Food is energy, and when you don’t supply your body with energy, it has to acquire it elsewhere. In this case, it turns to your fat stores or muscle. <strong>The latter is quite concerning as you certainly don’t want to burn fat at the expense of losing some muscle</strong>.\n\nThis has long been a concern especially among men. However, <a href=\"https://thefastdiet.co.uk/forums/topic/does-intermittent-fasting-lead-to-muscle-breakdown-and-protein-deficiency/\">studies</a> show that subjects that fasted actually lost fat and very little, if any, muscle.\n\nWhile beginners may initially feel lethargic, they may actually feel more energetic after their body becomes accustomed to it. This is because digestion requires energy; when there is nothing to digest, your body has “free” energy that can now be used to regulate other bodily functions, such as cleansing your body of toxins.\n\nThe whole concept that you need to keep your body supplied with calories, nutrients, and macronutrients at all times is an outdated concept. It certainly has its place, but it doesn’t mean your body will all of a sudden begin wasting away because you skipped your morning toast and OJ\n<h3>Exercising While Fasting</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25110046/Fotolia_77443772_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Running man sprinting for success on run.

This means you can perform a workout like HIIT on your fasting days at any time before your first meal.\n\nWhat about strength training? It’s actually against conventional wisdom to strength train on an empty stomach. A lot of personal trainers do not recommend it as it’s supposedly detrimental to strength gains and may even lead to muscle catabolism.\n\nHowever, it looks like conventional wisdom is being turned upside its head as studies show that this clearly isn’t the case. This <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00421-009-1289-x\">study</a> actually shows that resistance training in a fasted state <strong>may actually elicit a greater anabolic response than training in a fed state.</strong>\n\nNevertheless, there is still always the possibility of some muscle loss, <strong>which is why you should err on the side of caution and take a BCAA supplement before beginning a strenuous weight training session</strong>.

The human body is quite capable of coping during brief periods of hunger.

Here is everything you need to know about intermittent fasting.</h3>  \n\n<p>There seems to be new diet fads left and right, many of which contradict one another. Intermittent fasting is definitely NOT one of those diets.</p>\n\n<p>Yes It certainly challenges the conventional wisdom of eating six or more meals a day, but more and more scientific evidence are supporting the benefits of intermittent fasting, and people who practice it responsibly have sworn by it.</p>\n\n<p>If all the previous diets you have tried have only yielded mediocre results, then this diet just may be right for you.  </p>\n\n<h3>Intermittent Fasting 101</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25110046/Fasting-101.png\" alt=\"Fasting 101\" /></p>\n\n<p>Fasting, of course, entails going for a specific length of time without eating, or eating only small morsel of foods with very few calories, such as vegetables.</p>\n\n<p>People fast for a variety of reasons, and it’s not always voluntarily. In many underdeveloped nations where famine is rampant, people will fast for days when crops yielded little. What little food was available was given to their children so their offspring wouldn't go hungry.</p>\n\n<p>People also fast for religious observances. In the Muslim holiday Ramadan, followers refrain from eating or drinking while remaining in steadfast prayer and avoiding impure thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Today, many more people fast for health reasons, <strong>including accelerating fat loss and flushing the body of harmful toxins.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Even in the animal kingdom, various forms of wildlife fast on a routine daily basis. Since animals have to stalk prey to bring food to the dinner table, an unsuccessful hunt meant going for weeks without food.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike humans, they do not have the convenience of dropping by a grocery store and exchanging paper currency for a rack of lamb.</p>\n\n<p>The fasting duration varies in length and can range anywhere from half a day to as long as the body is physically able to survive without eating. The extreme end of the spectrum, though, is very dangerous and is almost never recommended by health professionals, or the reputable ones at least.</p>\n\n<p>With intermittent fasting, the duration is on the lower end and typically never more than 24 hours, and in most cases, much shorter at around 14 to 18 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s another point about fasting: everyone fasts whether they know it or not. When you wake up every morning, you just fasted for at least eight hours. That’s definitely a lot longer than you normally go between meals during your waking hours.</p>\n\n<p>With intermittent fasting, you’re just adding a few more hours on top of that.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3-iocPJNJig?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>  \n\n<h3>How to Fast</h3>  \n\n<p>Okay, so you’re sold on the idea of intermittent fasting. How do you go about doing it? The process is quite simple to follow and usually lasts for 16 hours, give or take an hour or two.</p>\n\n<p>The best part of all, half of the process is already completed for you since – as already mentioned – you fast every night during slumber. If you are getting the recommended eight hours of sleep, then you only need to get in another eight hours.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to get that in is by eating your last meal of the day a little earlier than usual and skipping breakfast the next morning. This should add up to 16 hours by the time lunch comes around. Here is a sample schedule of what this would look like:  </p>\n\n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Final meal of the day</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">8:00 pm</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Bedtime</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">12:00 am</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Bed rise</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">8:00 am</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td width=\"319\">Lunch</td>  \n<td width=\"319\">12:00 pm</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>  \n\n<p>The chart shows an entire 16 hour time frame. For some people, adhering to such a routine is as simple as skipping breakfast.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to, you may extend the fast by an additional hour or two by having the last meal of the day even earlier or pushing lunch back by an hour or so.  </p>\n\n<h3>How to Fight the Hunger</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25110046/The-Alpha-Male-Guide-to-Testosterone-and-Dominance-7-1024x719.jpg\" alt=\"Thumbs up for healthy diet\" /></p>\n\n<p>When you go for longer than usual without eating, hunger is going to set in. Everyone has a different hunger threshold. Some people find it unbearable while for others it’s nothing more than a mild discomfort that’s more than tolerable.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, it’s all mind over matter. Nevertheless, if you’re not accustomed to fasting, it can get quite uncomfortable. There are ways to help you cope so that your mind isn’t inundated with thoughts of food all day.</p>\n\n<p>One method is to take an appetite suppressing supplement. Some fat burners come with ingredients known for minimizing hunger. <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Rexx</a> is one example; it contains <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/rejuvenate-body-proven-power-green-tea-extract/\" target=\"_blank\">green tea</a>, which contains catecholamine, a compound proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17907825\">study</a> for reducing appetite.</p>\n\n<p>Coffee has also been shown to blunt appetite. Bro Labs <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/fighter-fuel?variant=14954915207\" target=\"_blank\">Fighter Fuel</a> coffee is a delicious and healthy coffee product that can help you fight off hunger.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to cope is to consume fibrous, crunchy vegetables. Sure, there are a few calories in vegetables, so technically, you’re breaking your fast, but the amount is negligible.</p>\n\n<p>Yet another way to combat hunger is by keeping yourself busy. According to some psychologists, <strong>some people eat as a way of fighting off boredom, and may confuse boredom for hunger</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>For many people, whether they realize it or not, eating is a form of entertainment. Keeping yourself busy with work, house errands, or any other productive activity prevents you from gravitating towards the fridge or daydreaming about a cheeseburger.</p>\n\n<p>Also know that you can ease into fasting gradually. Instead of a 16-hour fast, consider 14 hours or even 12. Pay attention to your body and notice how it feels.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, there will be hunger; take note of any other bodily sensations and go from there. If it feels manageable, then proceed with a 16-hour fast. If the hunger is making you too uncomfortable, then take the next few weeks to work your way up to that duration.  </p>\n\n<h3>Be Sure to Stay Hydrated</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25110046/Fotolia_84607707_Subscription_XL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of a athletic young man holding a water bottle, isolated over a gray background\" /></p>\n\n<p>Remember, fasting is about refraining from food, not fluids.. You can survive for about three weeks without food but only about three days without water, <strong>so drink up even if you only plan for a 16-hour fast.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aside from keeping you nicely hydrated, people who drank more water has also been shown in <a href=\"http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2010/august/clinical-trial-confirms-effectiveness-of-simple-appetite-control-method.html\">studies</a> to consume fewer calories overall, so good ol’ H2O certainly appears to have some appetite suppression qualities.</p>\n\n<p>Intermittent fasting, in fact, has also been referred to as water fasting since that’s all you’re consuming the entire duration.</p>\n\n<p>If the bland taste of water makes drinking a chore, then add some flavor by squeezing a few drops of lemon or lime juice. You can even substitute water for herbal tea or even <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/fighter-fuel?variant=14954915207\" target=\"_blank\">pure black coffee</a> minus the cream and sugar. These are all healthy beverages that contain antioxidants without the calories, or merely minuscule amounts.</p>\n\n<p>Some people also drink sparkling water, attesting that carbonated beverages are actually quite helpful for quelling appetite. It’s best that you stick to natural drinks since diet soda is filled with artificial sweeteners and colors. Fountain drinks, diet or not, are something that’s best saved for your cheat day.  </p>\n\n<h3>Any Side Effects?</h3>  \n\n<p>Intermittent fasting is generally safe, though some people do experience some mild side effects besides hunger. This may include dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and nausea. A few people also reported feeling irritable and like they can lose their temper at any moment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>All symptoms should subside within a week or so once your body adjusts</strong>. Side effects for the most part should be fairly mild. If it feels severe and you’re beginning to feel physically ill, then stop immediately. You may want to see your doctor before continuing in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Also be mindful that you definitely need to see a doctor before fasting if you have any preexisting medical conditions like diabetes.  </p>\n\n<h3>A Note About Calories</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25110046/Fotolia_68329552_Subscription_Monthly_XL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Nutrition facts\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you’re fasting for fat loss, know that the method alone will not help you burn off the pounds if it’s not accompanied by a calorie deficit. <strong>You still need to consume fewer calories overall</strong>. Some people consume unnecessarily large portions of food in their first meal after a fast. This almost negates the purpose and benefits.</p>\n\n<p>Look, it’s understandable; you haven’t eaten anything for 16 hours, and your stomach is demanding food. You’re more hungry than usual, and the very presence of food has you salivating.</p>\n\n<p>There will be temptation, but that’s where you need to exercise discipline. Don’t throw away everything you just worked for to satisfy a temporary craving.</p>\n\n<p>By the same token, you should also be careful not to overeat in your final meal before beginning a fast. Some people eat a large meal believing that it will hold off hunger longer during their prolonged period of no food. This is just as counterproductive.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re on a fat loss phase, then you should be counting calories. You should not be exceeding your established daily limit. When you come off a fast, you can’t all of a sudden reward yourself with an extra cheat day. You still need to consume clean foods and stay within your calorie count.</p>\n\n<p>Macronutrient ratios still continue to matter as well. That means getting plenty of protein with moderate carbs and fat intake. Fasting doesn’t change any of this or give you any extra leeway.  </p>\n\n<h3>How Often to Fast</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20110028/Fotolia_51634489_Subscription_Monthly_XL-e1453149692680-1024x673.jpg\" alt=\"Muscular young man holding clock. It is time for workout concept\" /></p>\n\n<p>There’s no set rule on how often you should fast. It depends largely on your own individual goals. For fat loss, try to have a fast day at least twice a week. You can also do three times a week or even every other day.</p>\n\n<p>It’s even recommended that you fast if you’re smack in the middle of a muscle, or “bulk up” phase. Fasting once to twice a week when you’re trying to build muscle may offset some fat gain.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, though, just as you need to maintain a calorie deficit while losing weight, you need to add calories while gaining lean mass. With that in mind, be sure you’re not cutting too many calories on your fast day.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to go on a longer fast or even a full 24 hours, then limit the fasting days to no more than twice a week.</p>\n\n<p>If you rotate between muscle building and fat loss phases, and want to incorporate intermittent fasting into your regimen, then consider a <a href=\"http://Brolabsmealplan.com\">customized meal plan</a> to take the guesswork out of food selection, ratios, and meal timing.  </p>\n\n<h3>Why Fasting Works</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/06110056/Fotolia_80046624_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"successful weight loss, white background, diet concept\" /></p>\n\n<p>So why does fasting work so well?

If you want to destroy your stubborn fat for good, read this article...</h3>\nOn the surface, fasted training appears to go against conventional wisdom. When you exert energy when the body has none to spare, it’s going to catabolize muscle. That’s the commonly accepted thinking adopted by most personal trainers and coaches in the industry.\n\nHowever, new studies are always coming forth and challenging old prevailing beliefs. Fasted training, as it turns out, just might prove to be beneficial in more ways than one. Most importantly, it will accelerate fat loss.\n<h3>1. Fasted Strength Training Increases Growth Hormones</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_84594056_Subscription_XXL-1024x665.jpg\" alt=\"Handsome power athletic man in training pumping up muscles with dumbbell. Strong bodybuilder with six pack, perfect abs, shoulders, biceps, triceps and chest. Image with clipping path\" />\n\nCardio on an empty stomach has long been the accepted norm, and there is ample evidence for why you should get in your HIIT before your first meal of the day. Resistance training while fasting, though, is an entirely different story.\n\nMost coaches recommend against it especially if you’re trying to build muscle. It’s long believed that fasted weight training actually has the opposite effect and may eat into muscle instead of stimulating and priming it for anabolic growth.\n\nThis line of thinking, though, has just been turned upside its head. Countless studies, such as <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC329619/?page=6\">this one</a>, <strong>show that growth hormones elevate by as much as 2,000% following a fasting period</strong>. When combined with strength training, which also elevates testosterone, then that is a hell of a lot of anabolic hormones circulating in your body. For you, <strong>that translates to lean mass growth</strong>.\n\nEven if you’re not interested in competing for the next Mr. Olympia title, it’s common knowledge that muscle burns calories, thus translating to more fat loss.\n\nHere’s another idea to ingest: Fasting induces autophagy. This is the ability of cells to shuttle toxins and endocrine disruptors out of the body. Impurities in the body are one of the greatest testosterone killers.\n<h3>2. Fasted Training Targets Fat Stores Directly</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/Fotolia_27002551_Subscription_Monthly_L-1024x530.jpg\" alt=\"bright flamy symbol on the black background\" />\n\nFor the most part, your body acquires energy from one of three sources. The first is from the foods you eat, which it breaks down and use for various bodily functions. If you’re in a fasted state, then your body has to get the energy from elsewhere, and that’s where it turns to the other two sources: fat and muscle. <strong>Your goal is to get the body to burn fat rather than muscle or recently consumed food.</strong>\n\nWhen you train in a fed state, that is, training not long after consuming a meal, then the body has no reason to target fat tissue when there is an abundant of readily available energy from your last meal.\n\nOn top of that, eating also raises insulin levels. While insulin is invaluable for shuttling nutrients and macronutrients into cells, it’s also more notoriously known for impairing the breakdown of fatty acids.\n\nWhen you’re in a fasted state, all foods consumed have been fully digested and insulin levels have returned to baseline. All energy expended at this point will come from body fat and muscle.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>To ensure that your body is only using fat stores for fuel, I recommend supplementing with a BCAA like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\">Revolt</a> so that your muscles are being fed during your intense workout session. </strong>.</p><p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Intermittent Fasting ≠Starvation</strong>.</p><p>\nWhen it comes to fasting, there is a lot of talk about the body going into “starvation mode.” When the body is in a state of starvation, that’s when the dreaded muscle catabolism begins.\n\nHere’s what you need to know: intermittent fasting does not equal starvation. The two are vastly different. Remember, a typical intermittent fast only lasts for about 16 hours, or 24 hours at the most. Your body doesn’t enter starvation mode simply because it went for a few hours more than usual without eating. Also, being hungry does not mean your body is in starvation mode.\n\nOne <a href=\"https://news.usc.edu/63669/fasting-triggers-stem-cell-regeneration-of-damaged-old-immune-system/\">study</a>, in fact, showed that even prolonged fasting – lasting two to four days – was actually beneficial for the body as it allowed for the regeneration of new immune cells. This is definitely not something the body can do if it’s breaking down from starvation.\n<h3>3. Intermittent Fasting Increases Catecholamines</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/03110042/Fotolia_88605131_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_88605131_Subscription_Monthly_XXL\" />\n\nFasting has also been shown in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6465309\">studies</a> to increase an organic compound known as catecholamines. Two types of catecholamines, adrenaline and noradrenaline, are <strong>known for elevating metabolism even while the body is at rest</strong>.\n\nMore specifically, these two catecholamines aid in the activation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), which resides in adipose fat tissue and is responsible for the release of fat from fat cells where it can be burned for energy.\n\nSeparate <a href=\"http://www.runnersworld.com/sweat-science/sprinting-for-weight-loss-are-catecholamines-the-secret\">studies</a> also show that high intensity cardio, such as <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/html5-blank/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">HIIT</a>, elevates catecholamines. It makes sense to believe then, that fasted HIIT has a double whammy effect on the levels of the compound released.\n\nAnother benefit of fasted training is that it promotes blood flow throughout the body and particularly in common “problem areas,” such as the lower abdominals or areas where body fat tends to accumulate. The increased blood flow makes it easier for catecholamines to travel to these so-called troubled spots where it can activate HSL.\n\nIn simplified terms, fasted training promotes MORE fat loss and specifically more from stubborn fat sources.\n<h3>4. Intermittent Fasting Increases Performance</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31110050/The-Truth-About-Running-and-Testosterone-What-You-Need-to-Know-Before-Getting-on-the-Treadmill-5-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Man ready to run on the track\" />\n\nFasting or not, when you train, you have to perform at your very best. Results, after all, do not come from mediocre effort. Fasted training, though, is long believed to inhibit performance; after all, you are working out without readily available macronutrients circulating in the blood.\n\nIndeed, some people do experience diminished performance when training in a fasted state. Everyone is different after all, and people respond differently to the effects food, or lack of it, on exercise.\n\nHowever, even if an empty stomach makes exercise feel awkward, the effects are usually just temporary and subside once your body adjusts. Any decline in performance can also usually be offset by taking a<a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\"> BCAA supplement</a>.\n\nThis <a href=\"https://www.otsuka.co.jp/en/health_illness/bcaa/stamina/\">study</a> showed that subjects administered a BCAA supplement showed improved oxygen intake and blood lactate concentration during a cycling exercise.\n\nFasted training, in fact, is a staple practice among Kenyan runners, many of which compete at the world level and have taken home many Olympic gold medals. Granted, these are endurance runners who train for long-distance runs, not exactly the exercise you want to be doing for maximum fat loss. Nevertheless, it does <strong>show that there is serious validity behind the effects of intermittent fasting on physical performance enhancement.</strong>\n\nIt’s not just endurance athletes, though, that train fasted. Husain and Hamza Abdullah are two brothers and players in the NFL who sometimes train fasted when observing the Muslim holiday Ramadan.\n\nFootball training consists of short bursts of explosive energy to prime players for that 100-yard dash. Their coaches have devised a plan that allows them to train at an optimum state while adhering to their fasting requirements during the religious observance.\n\nYou can read about the Abdullah brothers’ story <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/trainingcamp/story/09000d5d8199a654/article/vikings-abdullah-prepares-to-mix-30day-fast-with-football\">here</a> and how they integrate fasting into their training for maximum performance. It is said that even a few other players are following suit.\n\nFasted training, and strength training especially, is no longer taboo and is becoming more accepted and mainstream. This is a huge revelation because when it comes to fat loss, you have to train near your maximum output.\n\nIf you’re not exerting near your VO2 max, then you’re not doing HIIT; you’re practically doing regular aerobics at a moderate pace. That, as you should know, does not burn fat at optimum levels and is even accompanied by some muscle loss.\n<h3>5. Fasted Training Lowers Insulin Levels</h3>\nThis was briefly discussed earlier, though it warrants a much more in-depth look. Insulin is vital as it helps distribute the nutrients from the foods we eat to the muscles and organs where they can be properly utilized. Eating, even if it’s a low-carb, high-protein meal, releases insulin.\n\nOf course, this is a good thing; the problem, though, is that if you eat too much and too often, <strong>the body becomes insulin-resistant, and this is a precursor for developing type II diabetes</strong>.  Fasting, therefore, is useful in this aspect as it reduces the number of times you eat, thus preventing the constant release of insulin that can lead to insulin resistance over time.\n\nUnbeknownst to most people, and even to science until recently, insulin may also have an indirect effect on your fat levels. <strong>Insulin sensitivity also increases fat stores in areas not normally designed to store fat, such as the liver and muscles.</strong> This is known as visceral fat.\n\nWhen you train while fasted, the body uses up the fat stores in the body, thus shrinking the size of the lipid droplets in the liver and muscle cells. Interestingly enough, the body’s response to insulin becomes more powerful as the fat stores in the liver and muscles decreases. This was proven in this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16732018\">study</a>.\n<h3>6. Fasted Training Makes You Less Hungry</h3>\n<img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25110046/The-Alpha-Male-Guide-to-Testosterone-and-Dominance-7-1024x719.jpg\" alt=\"Thumbs up for healthy diet\" />\n\nHere’s news that may surprise you: the very act of eating is actually what makes you hungry. Conventional wisdom has you believe that the body gets hungry because it doesn’t eat. Well, this isn’t exactly how it works.\n\nBelieve it or not, lack of food is not what makes you hungry, or at least not directly. <strong>It’s actually the production of a hormone called ghrelin that determines your hunger level.</strong>\n\nYour body produces ghrelin in response to eating. When you establish a set eating pattern, such as eating every two to three hours, your body produces ghrelin that keeps you hungry, so that you begin to feel the hunger pang if you go for longer than the usual three hours without a meal.\n\nWhen you train fasted, or even just fast for the first time, the presence of ghrelin will be sending signals to your body that it’s hungry. This includes all the sensations associated with a growling tummy.</p><p>However, once your body adjusts after several weeks, it will adapt by producing less ghrelin. This explains why intermittent fasting becomes more tolerable as you make it a routine practice.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Even if the hunger does become quite nagging in the early stages, this can easily be offset by taking a fat burning supplement with appetite suppressing ingredients, such as <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-rexx-extreme?variant=16323018695\">Tea Rexx</a>.</strong>.</p><p>\nLess hunger means less eating, and less eating means more body fat coming off in less time.\n<h3>Is Fasted Training Right for You?</h3>\nThe benefits of intermittent fasting itself are far-reaching. When combined with exercise,<strong> it turns your body into a fat-burning furnace! </strong>It’s definitely worth a shot, and if you already do HIIT or fast every now and then, then it’s only a matter of combining the two.\n\nFasted training isn’t the only way to six-pack abs, and for some people, it might just not be a good fit. However, with its documented benefits, it’s at least worth several weeks of trial.\n\nIn any case, if you do decide to give it a shot, then be sure to take a serving of BCAAs before you get your HIIT or strength training session underway.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Using a product like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\">Revolt</a> ensures that your muscles are supplied with the essential amino acids; it’s a safe measure of keeping your muscles fueled for preventing a catabolic response.</strong>.</p><p>\"","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Fasted Training has an abundance of fat burning and muscle building benefits backed by science. If you want to destroy your stubborn fat for good, read this article...</h3>  \n\n<p>On the surface, fasted training appears to go against conventional wisdom. When you exert energy when the body has none to spare, it’s going to catabolize muscle. That’s the commonly accepted thinking adopted by most personal trainers and coaches in the industry.</p>\n\n<p>However, new studies are always coming forth and challenging old prevailing beliefs. Fasted training, as it turns out, just might prove to be beneficial in more ways than one. Most importantly, it will accelerate fat loss.  </p>\n\n<h3>1. Fasted Strength Training Increases Growth Hormones</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04110032/Fotolia_84594056_Subscription_XXL-1024x665.jpg\" alt=\"Handsome power athletic man in training pumping up muscles with dumbbell. Strong bodybuilder with six pack, perfect abs, shoulders, biceps, triceps and chest. Image with clipping path\" /></p>\n\n<p>Cardio on an empty stomach has long been the accepted norm, and there is ample evidence for why you should get in your HIIT before your first meal of the day. Resistance training while fasting, though, is an entirely different story.</p>\n\n<p>Most coaches recommend against it especially if you’re trying to build muscle. It’s long believed that fasted weight training actually has the opposite effect and may eat into muscle instead of stimulating and priming it for anabolic growth.</p>\n\n<p>This line of thinking, though, has just been turned upside its head. Countless studies, such as <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC329619/?page=6\">this one</a>, <strong>show that growth hormones elevate by as much as 2,000% following a fasting period</strong>. When combined with strength training, which also elevates testosterone, then that is a hell of a lot of anabolic hormones circulating in your body. For you, <strong>that translates to lean mass growth</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you’re not interested in competing for the next Mr. Olympia title, it’s common knowledge that muscle burns calories, thus translating to more fat loss.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s another idea to ingest: Fasting induces autophagy. This is the ability of cells to shuttle toxins and endocrine disruptors out of the body. Impurities in the body are one of the greatest testosterone killers.  </p>\n\n<h3>2. Fasted Training Targets Fat Stores Directly</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/28110029/Fotolia_27002551_Subscription_Monthly_L-1024x530.jpg\" alt=\"bright flamy symbol on the black background\" /></p>\n\n<p>For the most part, your body acquires energy from one of three sources. The first is from the foods you eat, which it breaks down and use for various bodily functions. If you’re in a fasted state, then your body has to get the energy from elsewhere, and that’s where it turns to the other two sources: fat and muscle. <strong>Your goal is to get the body to burn fat rather than muscle or recently consumed food.</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you train in a fed state, that is, training not long after consuming a meal, then the body has no reason to target fat tissue when there is an abundant of readily available energy from your last meal.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, eating also raises insulin levels. While insulin is invaluable for shuttling nutrients and macronutrients into cells, it’s also more notoriously known for impairing the breakdown of fatty acids.</p>\n\n<p>When you’re in a fasted state, all foods consumed have been fully digested and insulin levels have returned to baseline. All energy expended at this point will come from body fat and muscle. <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>To ensure that your body is only using fat stores for fuel, I recommend supplementing with a BCAA like <a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\">Revolt</a> so that your muscles are being fed during your intense workout session. </strong>.</p><p> <br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Intermittent Fasting ≠Starvation</strong>.</p><p> <br />\nWhen it comes to fasting, there is a lot of talk about the body going into “starvation mode.” When the body is in a state of starvation, that’s when the dreaded muscle catabolism begins.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s what you need to know: intermittent fasting does not equal starvation. The two are vastly different. Remember, a typical intermittent fast only lasts for about 16 hours, or 24 hours at the most. Your body doesn’t enter starvation mode simply because it went for a few hours more than usual without eating. Also, being hungry does not mean your body is in starvation mode.</p>\n\n<p>One <a href=\"https://news.usc.edu/63669/fasting-triggers-stem-cell-regeneration-of-damaged-old-immune-system/\">study</a>, in fact, showed that even prolonged fasting – lasting two to four days – was actually beneficial for the body as it allowed for the regeneration of new immune cells. This is definitely not something the body can do if it’s breaking down from starvation.  </p>\n\n<h3>3. Intermittent Fasting Increases Catecholamines</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/03110042/Fotolia_88605131_Subscription_Monthly_XXL-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_88605131_Subscription_Monthly_XXL\" /></p>\n\n<p>Fasting has also been shown in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6465309\">studies</a> to increase an organic compound known as catecholamines. Two types of catecholamines, adrenaline and noradrenaline, are <strong>known for elevating metabolism even while the body is at rest</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>More specifically, these two catecholamines aid in the activation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), which resides in adipose fat tissue and is responsible for the release of fat from fat cells where it can be burned for energy.</p>\n\n<p>Separate <a href=\"http://www.runnersworld.com/sweat-science/sprinting-for-weight-loss-are-catecholamines-the-secret\">studies</a> also show that high intensity cardio, such as <a href=\"http://brandoncarter.com/html5-blank/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">HIIT</a>, elevates catecholamines. It makes sense to believe then, that fasted HIIT has a double whammy effect on the levels of the compound released.</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit of fasted training is that it promotes blood flow throughout the body and particularly in common “problem areas,” such as the lower abdominals or areas where body fat tends to accumulate. The increased blood flow makes it easier for catecholamines to travel to these so-called troubled spots where it can activate HSL.</p>\n\n<p>In simplified terms, fasted training promotes MORE fat loss and specifically more from stubborn fat sources.  </p>\n\n<h3>4. Intermittent Fasting Increases Performance</h3>  \n\n<p><img src=\"http://d3uzljx5hhrq8p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31110050/The-Truth-About-Running-and-Testosterone-What-You-Need-to-Know-Before-Getting-on-the-Treadmill-5-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Man ready to run on the track\" /></p>\n\n<p>Fasting or not, when you train, you have to perform at your very best. Results, after all, do not come from mediocre effort. Fasted training, though, is long believed to inhibit performance; after all, you are working out without readily available macronutrients circulating in the blood.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, some people do experience diminished performance when training in a fasted state. Everyone is different after all, and people respond differently to the effects food, or lack of it, on exercise.</p>\n\n<p>However, even if an empty stomach makes exercise feel awkward, the effects are usually just temporary and subside once your body adjusts. Any decline in performance can also usually be offset by taking a<a href=\"http://www.brolaboratories.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\"> BCAA supplement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.otsuka.co.jp/en/health_illness/bcaa/stamina/\">study</a> showed that subjects administered a BCAA supplement showed improved oxygen intake and blood lactate concentration during a cycling exercise.</p>\n\n<p>Fasted training, in fact, is a staple practice among Kenyan runners, many of which compete at the world level and have taken home many Olympic gold medals.

We got a good one today!\n\nSo, you know my World Tour, right? Well we were just in Toronto, Canada and it was awesome!\n\nThe room was PACKED and we had some real heavy hitters come through to speak! Check out the whole video:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHRNNxKfY-A\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\"\nTo kick things off we had my boy White Boy Brian tell a heart-braking story about his brother and he has such a deep passion for biology and what this whole business means to him. I would tell you what it is, but it just wouldn't do it any justice. You're just going to have to watch the video..\n\nThen, we had Yahya Bakkar come up and explain the TRUE meaning of Confidence and how you obtain it. According to him,  your confidence levels are influenced by where you derive your sense of value. DAMN! He went on to explain his \"three rings of confidence\" and how you can use them to gain the confidence you always needed to ask for that promotion, or take that girl out..\n\nUp Next was the homie Raymond Duke, the million dollar copy-writer. He had a presentation on how to \"Stop Being a Whore.\" No, we weren't talking to a room of prostitutes, it's more like a metaphor lol. If you look at whore's career she is always trading her time for money. You pay her for an hour or two and she leaves after unless you pay her more. Now how does a job work? The same way! You come in, do what you are told to do whether you like it or not and then leave. Stop being a whore bro, come to the Renegade Summit ;)\n\nAfter Raymond we had my friends from Honest Signalz talk. Honest Signalz are made of two dating coaches and they gave a great talk about developing relationships in social life and in business. They spoke on coming into every environment with a positive attitude because it keep you open to new people and opportunities. Also, they spoke on the importance of finding a niche and branding your business towards the right market.\n\nAfterward we had my little bro Kinobody (Greg O' Gallagher) come up and talk about a scene from Fight Club and how success is actually pretty simple but what we all need is a gun-to-the head mentality to get us through to the otherside..\n\nThen Doc Testosterone came in with his fly suit and gave a great speech about his father's extreme pressure as a child. He made him study for hours and hours, past the point of exhaustion. This forced him to be extremely theoretical, but completely action-less. He knew a lot of things but couldn't apply them in real life. He showed the audience how to change their brain and start thinking less and doing MORE!Next up to bat was one of the living legends, Vince Del Monte! He talked about a \"Mafia Mentality\". How to keep certain people in and certain people out of your circle. The power of networking and how to find those key players that will take your life and your business to the next level!\n\nI wrapped everything up by exposing the importance of money and how the lack of it puts people into bondage. After putting the fear into them (lol) I gave a presentation on the strategies anyone can use to grow an online business..\n\nIt was really awesome hanging out with everyone in Toronto and I hope to see YOU at the next one!

Choose wisely.Lesson Two: <b>Always Plan Ahead</b>\n\nOn his way to the top, Tony faced (what appeared to be) impossible obstacles. Enemies tried to steal his business, “friends” backstabbed him, and his own Mama did her best to keep him from going after what he wanted.

You must adapt this mentality in your road from Scrawny Wimp to Jacked Pimp. Somebody at the gym hogging the bench? Do push ups until you can no longer feel your arms. The gym’s not open? Have a portable pull up bar and exercise mat, find some scaffolding, hit the floor, just do whatever it takes. Take the drug of excess paranoia and planning for everything, instead of b*tching about it with a self pity hug. Lesson Three: <b>Don’t Waste Opportunity </b>\n\nAs I said at the beginning, this the most important lesson. Throughout the film, Tony consistently takes advantage of every opportunity he gets. He hears there’s a way for him to go from a slum in a ghetto to Downtown Miami and he immediately takes action. Next he gets a chance to fly to Bolivia to meet the wealthiest man in the country and secures a multi-million dollar deal. The key here is...<b>He never hesitates and is rewarded for his decisive action every single time. </b>So when you see these opportunities, take the drug of massive action. You simply don’t have the luxury of hugging it out with yourself and your uncertainties and half-assed-ness, as time waits for no one.

There are 3 critical reasons why you, your kid and even your grandma need to be pushed around. <b>#1: Bullying Teaches You Patience</b>\n\nRemember the Karate Kid? If you didn’t see it, a young fella named Daniel is getting his butt whipped by these bullies so he gets help from this Japanese combat expert, Mr. Miyagi. While Danny wants to practice flying punches, falcon kicks and other gangsta sh*t, Mr. Miyagi forces him to begin with simple and boring movements.

Mr Miyagi quickly corrects him, saying no, you train so you<i> don’t</i> have to fight.

Once I did, I never had to fight again because of the new confidence I had in myself, both mentally and physically.\n\n<b>#3: Bullying Teaches You Reality</b>\n\nToo many kids today coast through life getting everything they cry for. Our current culture of last place medals, safe spaces and “trigger warnings” is creating the softest generation humanity has ever seen. While well-intentioned, this is NOT how life works. People will say and do things you don’t like. If you lose, you f**king lose and are punished for it. Perhaps a wedgie or two would help these snowflake bubble boys to understand that. So there you have it. Bullying is good for you. Use it to your advantage by learning patience, prevention and how the world works.
